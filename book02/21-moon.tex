If a malefic is with it or aspects it, it will cut off [his] hope, and if he is master of something he will not take pleasure in it. 

If a benefic aspects it without a malefic, then he will be a powerful chief [and] a commander.

If a malefic and a benefic aspect it, then he will be miserable [but] will attain some nobility and status, or his brothers will die a terrible death.''
