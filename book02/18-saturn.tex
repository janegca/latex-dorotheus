\item[\Saturn,\Jupiter]
the person ``will abound in landed estates [and will be] the steward for kings and nobles, entrusted with properties of other than his own, and...will be noble if \Mars\, does not aspect''

\item[\Saturn,\Mars]
``indicates good in [his] character, but there will be no good in regard to his property, and reason will keep him waiting, and he will marry, and his body will be weakened, and [his] bile and black bile will be aroused against him, and his father will die before his mother, and he will spoil his father's property, and he will turn to his brothers who were born before him because they will die or their disease[s] will be severe, and grief will come [upon him] and dependence, misery and blemish. And if \Jupiter\, aspects, it will make easy and dissipate this misery [and he will] bear it''

\item[\Saturn,\Sun] ``he will spoil his father's property and his end will come to misery, and worse than this in a nocturnal nativity, [if \Saturn] is eastern or western, with regard to his father and his brothers and his own peculiarity\footnote{Dykes has ``and especially to himself.''}. 

If the \Sun\, is in less degrees, then it is more terrible and worse because a horrible death will come to his father and like this, as I told you, of what the native will suffer, and he will fall from his good fortune, and disease from dampness and weakness will befall him, and he will love building[s] and sometimes will acquire wealth from them so that his living is from them, but still he will be miserable. 

If it is in the house of the \Sun\, or in the house of \Saturn, it indicates that his father will be noble and will not be discomforted, but the native will be hostile to his father, and what is like this as I mentioned''

\item[\Saturn,\Venus]
``he will marry a blemished woman for whom he will not be suitable, or he will have intercourse with a barren woman or one whom there is a chronic illness, and he will be blemished and will be despised because of this, and he will have few children, and the one for whom children are judged will have few male [children]; he will have no constancy toward women [and] will have no comfort, but it will chill him; and according to that practice predict in the nativities of women''

\item[\Saturn,\Mercury]
``he will be a lisper, cumbersome with [his] tongue, slight in [his] work, but a calm man, a smart fellow [and] profound''

\item[\Saturn,\Moon]
``will spoil the good of his mother and her work, and she will be emaciated, [but it will be] strong in decrease for his mother's property, weak in [his] body and in his mother's similarly. 

If the \Moon\, is increasing and the nativity diurnal while the benefics aspect, then it will remove the evils. 

If the nativity is nocturnal and the \Moon\, is increasing or decreasing in the aspect of \Jupiter\, and \Venus, then it indicates an increase in everything''
