\section{Arrival of Mars in the Places}

\textsc{Ascendent} \hfill \\
\indent If the chart is diurnal ``it indicates misery and pain and decrease in his good, and he will be malicious in character, have few children, be filled up forcibly\footnote{Dykes says the person will be ``full of anger'' p.165}, [and] he will love debauchery and do this in other than charity and the like; it indicates similarly in the nativities of women, and it is worse than this if \Saturn\, aspects, but better than it if \Jupiter\, aspects because it strengthens him [the native] and he will be welcome.

But if \Mars\, is in the ascendent while [one] luminary is in the West \textsl{[7th]} and the other in the cardine under the earth \textsl{[4th]}, and \Jupiter\, is cadent, then his parents will die suddenly a terrible death, and the native will be taken, but will not remain long in prison, and chronic illness will be in him, and this will be as if he had no upbringing and good.

If in nocturnal nativities \Mars\, is in the ascendent in a feminine sign while \Jupiter\, aspects, then it indicates intelligence and prosperity in [his] work and courage and daring, and besides this he will not escape from any of the misery.'' \\

\noindent\textsc{2nd Place (Property, Assets)} \hfill \\
\indent ``If \Mars\, is in the house of property, it indicates the ruination of his property, but if a benefic aspects, then it will spoil some and leave some behind.''

\noindent\textsc{Midheaven or 11th Place} \hfill \\
``If \Mars\, is in the midheaven in diurnal nativities or in what follows the midheaven, then it indicates a fall and a terrible flight from his land. 

If this sign is tropical(\Aries,\Cancer,\Libra,\Capricorn) or possesses two bodies \textsl{[mutable: \Gemini, \Virgo, \Sagittarius, \Pisces]}, then he will return to his city, especially if a benefic aspects it, but if a malefic aspects, he will spoil his father's property, especially if the \Sun\, aspects. The calamity is less in nocturnal births, especially if \Jupiter\, aspects because \Jupiter\, diminishes the indolence and evil and increases the reason [and] intelligence.''

\noindent\textsc{Midheaven or 4th Place} \hfill \\
\indent ``If \Mars\, is with the \Moon\, in the midheaven or under the earth, he will destroy property and goods, but if a malefic\footnote{Dykes has "and if a fortune looked" (p165), which makes more sense, you'd expect an aspect from another malefic to increase the destruction, not repair it.} aspects, the native will repair what he had destroyed.''

\noindent\textsc{Descendent} \hfill \\
\indent ``If \Mars\, is in opposition to the ascendent, then it is bad because he [the native] will die or run away from his city or fall in misery, and it is worse than this if it is in other than its portion\footnote{Dykes reads this a being in its own ``sect'', although the Greeks used ``portion'' to mean ``degree'' so it may refer to being in its own bounds or terms.} and not in its place as misfortune and fire and disobedience will come to him from an evil act. Know which this is of the kinds of signs in which \Mars\, is.

If \Jupiter\, aspects, it will make it easy for him, and misfortune will come to some of them until they look at death, [but] then they will escape.''

If \Mars\, ``aspects the \Sun\, or \Moon, it indicates his separation from his parents and his deflection from a livelihood.'' 

If the \Moon\, is waxing and aspecting \Mars\, ``then it will be bad because sometimes death and a terrible harm will come to him, and this will come to some of them in individuals or things, and with this misery he will be taken in blood.

If \Jupiter\, does not present itself, it will increase that which I mentioned very much, but in nocturnal nativities less.''
