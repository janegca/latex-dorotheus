\section{Lot of Children}
To find the lot of children count from \Jupiter\, to \Saturn\, by day, or from \Saturn\, to \Jupiter\, by night, and project the result from the Ascendant. 

If the lot is in an angle or a good place, the indications for having children are good. If it is in a sign of ``few children, then it indicates a small number of children''. If \Saturn\, is with the lot then the person ``will be sterile or will have few children or will be grieved with an intense grief on account of [his] children.''

If the lot is in the 6th or 12th place, ``then neither a male nor a female will be born to him, and he will suffer distress and grief from this; but if he should have children, they will not stay with him so that they will part from him in the cities.''

Planets square or opposed to the lot indicate ``a multitude of children'' but if no planets are square or opposed to the lot, ``then these [natives] have a need for children.''

The number of signs between the lot and its domicile ruler indicate the number of children. If the signs hold a malefic, the children will die.

If the \Sun\, is square or opposed to the lot, it will increase the number of male children; the \Moon\, square or opposed increases the number of female children.

If there is no planet in or aspecting the lot the first child will miscarry or die horribly.

\Jupiter\, and \Mercury\, indicate children if they are in good places but deny them if they are in sterile signs (\Gemini, \Leo, \Virgo, \Capricorn, the beginning of \Taurus, the middle of \Libra, \Aries\, and \Sagittarius.) \Aquarius\, abounds in children, as does \Scorpio\, but it also indicates their death.
