If \Mercury\, is in a house or terms of:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[\Saturn] ``he will be dumb or lisping or deaf, silent, [and] he will inform no one of what is in himself, [he will be] contemplative, inquiring about all the affairs of men so that he will be enthusiastic about this and some of them will know the secrets of the book which [belong] to the people of religions, and some of them will be learned in the stars, and some of them will drive away birds [be augurs]''

\item[\Jupiter] ``he will possess dignity, [be] an orator, or control the affairs of kings or nobles, or instruct the people in words and arguments and judgments, and he will always be about the business of metropolises or kings''

\item[\Mars] ``he will be a fool, insignificant, a liar with no shame, and he will not believe in God or in good work[s and] he will love adultery, and some of them will act with perfidy, and some of them will keep company with magicians or confer with them or investigate their affair[s] in regard to measures, and they will refuse to receive religion, and the people will treat them as enemies who have no fidelity and no good reputation''

\item[\Venus] ``he will be welcome, pleasant, rejoicing, [and] he will do all his work [and] will hurry it up and will press on with it, and some of them will be learned or intuitive or wealthy or will make dye[s], and some of them will be learned in backgammon and the like; if \Mercury\, is in a cardine free of the [\Sun's] rays, then he will be intuitive, intelligent, acquisitive of property, needing everyone''
