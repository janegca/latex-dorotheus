\section{Venus in the Places}
\noindent\textsc{Ascendent and 2nd Place}

If \Venus\, is rising before the \Sun\, and ``rejoicing in its light\footnote{Visible and in sect.}, he will be praiseworthy, handsome, a master of women, well known among kings and lords of men, well known in metropolises and cities, and some of them will have intercourse with the women of the rich, but they will not profit or excel by means of this, and some of them will occupy houses of worship [and will be] pure (we have seen something like this), great, one whom praise will lift up and his head will be crowned and he will be good in [his] character [and] will love wealth, especially if the \Moon\, aspects.

If with this \Mars\, and \Mercury\, aspect, he will be delighted with joy, openly rich in this. 

If with this, \Saturn\, aspects, he will have intercourse with a mature woman who is not praiseworthy and its not famous for goodness. Predict like this in the nativities of women.''

\noindent\textsc{Ascendent}

In the ascendent in a double-bodied sign (\Gemini, \Virgo, \Sagittarius, \Pisces) ``the native will be named with [the names of] two fathers or two mothers or with two names.''

\Venus\, and \Mercury\, in the ascendent and \Mars\, in the 7th ``indicates ruination of his father's property and the expenditure of what was acquired because of nobles and the quest for knowledge and approaching houses of worship because he will seek glory and high rnk, but will fall in quarrel[s] because of an evil affair or on account of a woman, and he will be seized because of blood or poison, a shameless fellow, and emptiness and fear will reach him from this, but this evil will fade away by his donating property---afterwards he will be in charge of death. If \Jupiter\,  aspects, it will diminish the evil, but if \Jupiter\, does not aspect, misery will reach him and flight and a fall from his property; in the nativities of women they will have intercourse with the nobles and some of them will get remuneration and profit.''

If \Venus\, is in the ascendent and \Saturn\, is in the 7th, ``it indicates his wife will give him poison to drink so that he will die by means of it.''

If \Venus, is in the ascendant and \Saturn\, is in the 10th, ``he will be satisfied, wealthy, he will believe in God and will be a mightier noble than his fathers were, and he will travel to many cities and countries, but he will return to his city and will fall into contracts because of women, and children will be born to him unless a malefic aspects...predict similarly in the nativities of women.''

If \Venus\,  is in a feminine sign, ``it indicaes that his mother is of nobler lineage than his father and she will live long.''

\noindent\textsc{Ascendent, 10th or 4th}

If \Venus\, and \Mercury\, are in the ascendent, MC or IC while being east of the \Sun, ``it indicates nobility and honor and praise in groups of people, and this will be because of insight and knowledge'' and it is better if they are in a feminine or tropical sign.

If \Venus\, is in the ascendent or 10th and aspects the \Moon, ``it indicates marriage to one of his relatives.''

\noindent\textsc{Midheaven, IC or 5th}

The person will be ``praiseworthy [and] welcome, but if a malefic aspects'' \Venus, it diminishes her power.

In a woman's chart, \Venus\, in the 10th in a masculine sign indicates the woman will be a harlot and if \Mars\, or \Mercury\, aspects \Venus, the woman will be a lesbian, especially if the \Moon\, also aspects from a masculine sign.

In a man's chart, if \Venus\, is in a feminine sign, ``he will not be satisfied and the character of a woman will be in him, [he will be] weak; if \Saturn\, aspects, it will enfeeble him and make it difficult for him in the acts of \Venus.

\noindent\textsc{Descendent}

\Venus\, in the 7th ``indicates that he will have a good end except that he will have no good in marriage, especially if there is none between these two [?]\footnote{Could possibly mean if there is no friendship between the two places.} without the aspect of \Jupiter. But if \Venus\, is in this place in nativities of women, then [it indicates] what is better than this because she will be one of those who do not perform the act of \Venus\, in an unnatural way. But if the \Moon\, is with it [\Venus] in the West in the nativities of of men, then he will be effeminate and will marry a whore whom many men have had intercourse with.''

\noindent\textsc{IC}

If \Venus\, is in a masculine sign in a day chart, ``it indicates disgrace because of women, and if \Saturn\, or \Mars\, aspects he will see the death of his women; if the sign is tropical, then it will not happen once but many times.''
