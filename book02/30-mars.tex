\item[\Jupiter] ``If \Mars\, is in \Jupiter's house or its term, he will be friendly with kings, beloved among them; if \Jupiter\, is aspecting \Mars\, which is in its house, then he will be one of the nobles and commanders of armies, a leader of soldiers and forces, and he will be ruling in cities, one who has ascended in nobility''
