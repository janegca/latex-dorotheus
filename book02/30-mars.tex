\section{Mars in Another Planet's House}
If \Mars\, is in the house or terms of:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[\Saturn] ``he will be pleasant, courageous, agile, in what he improves, but he will squander his father's property and kill his younger brothers''

\item[\Jupiter] ``If \Mars\, is in \Jupiter's house or its term, he will be friendly with kings, beloved among them; if \Jupiter\, is aspecting \Mars\, which is in its house, then he will be one of the nobles and commanders of armies, a leader of soldiers and forces, and he will be ruling in cities, one who has ascended in nobility''

\item[\Venus] ``If \Mars\, is in \Venus's house or its term, then he will be a master of fornication, he will love the women of others, and he will harm his relatives, and he will rejoice in an evil sexual intercourse, and most of them [will be men] who murder their wives with their own hand and consider how the death of their women may occur''

\item[\Mercury] ``If \Mars\, is in \Mercury's house or term, then he will be reasonable, desirous of marriage, clear in [his] thinking, intelligent, but he will collect property illegally and will be poor and an ascetic in his work''

\item[\Moon] ``he will be sharp in his reasoning, a seeker for work and property except that his work and his livelihood will weaken and he will be chronically ill or will die a terrible death, and he will have a short life or little property, [but] will abound in disease; it is worse for one who is born in the daytime''

\item[\Sun] ``he will spoil his father's property and rob it, and he will be one of those who do difficult and unpleasant work in fire or iron, and his livelihood will be from this. 

If \Mars\, and \Saturn\, are both in a house of the \Sun\, or the \Moon, they indicate the shortness of [his] life or the terribleness of [his] death''
