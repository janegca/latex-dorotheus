\section{Marriage}
\subsection{Indications from Venus}
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item \Venus's triplicity rulers, visible and direct, with \Venus, or angular or succedent or in trine to her gives good indications for marriage

\item if \Venus's triplicity rulers are cadent or in bad places, ``corrupted'' or USB then it is unlikely the native will marry or that he will marry disgraced women or one very old or very young

\item if \Venus's triplicity rulers are in bad condition but \Venus\, is with a benefic planet, both being in good condition, then the wife will be agreeable but if the triplicity rulers are between \Venus\, and the benefic ``they indicate disaster and disgrace because of women and anxiety and grief because of them\footnote{Sense of the passage is that \Venus, the benefic, and one or more triplicity rulers are together in a bad place.}.''

\item \Venus\, with \Jupiter\, in a good place indicates marriage to an agreeable wife

\item  in a diurnal chart, if \Venus\, is cadent and aspected by \Jupiter\, and \Mars\, while her triplicity lords are in the midheaven marriage to a well-known (\Jupiter\, indicates fame) whore who brings disgrace on the man is indicated

\item if \Venus\, is with, overcome by, or opposed by a malefic the person's life ``will revolve in grief and misery because of women, especially if the malefic is the \Moon''

\item \Mercury\, in \Taurus\, or \Libra, aspected by \Saturn\, indicates marriage to a slave girl, or servant, or stranger

\item \Jupiter\, with \Venus\, ``predict...intercourse with a praiseworthy woman'' and if \Jupiter\, aspects the \Moon\,  the intercourse is ``with his mistress or his lady or the wife of one of the nobles'' and if \Saturn\, or \Mars\, also aspect the \Moon\, (``which is the king of the night''), say the same if the nativity is that of a woman\footnote{Presumably the person, being a woman, will sleep with her husband or the husbands of noble women.}

\item \Venus\, USB in the 1st or 10th and \Mars\, in an angle or with the lot of wedding, indicates marriage to someone ``of the lowest [class], a stranger and a pauper'' and if \Mercury\, and \Venus\, both aspect the lot of wedding, marriage to ``a singer or dancer'' is indicated
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Indications from the 7th Place}

If malefics aspect the 7th and the ruler of the 7th is cadent or in the aspect of malefics or in a bad position then, the person will suffer injury from the ruler because of:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[\Saturn] the father, mature men, or the dead
\item[\Jupiter] kings, wealthy men, or a ``decree of the city''
\item[\Mercury] argument and talk, or marriage to a woman who'd once been a concubine and was stolen away by thieves
\item[\Mars] a shameful and disgraceful marriage and if \Mercury\, is with \Mars\, the person ``will kill his wife with his own hand and [her] blood will stick to him'' and if \Mars\, is with \Venus\, ``the bride's dowry is damaged, and she will be furious with him''
\end{itemize}
