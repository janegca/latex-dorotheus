\subsection{Indications from Venus}
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item \Venus's triplicity rulers, visible and direct, with \Venus\, or angular or succedent or in trine to her gives good indications for marriage

\item if \Venus's triplicity rulers are cadent or in bad places, ``corrupted'' or USB then it is unlikely the native will marry or that he will marry disgraced women or one very old or very young

\item if \Venus's triplicity rulers are in bad condition but \Venus\, is with a benefic planet, both being in good condition, then the wife will be agreeable but if the triplicity rulers are between \Venus\, and the benefic ``they indicate disaster and disgrace because of women and anxiety and grief because of them\footnote{Sense of the passage is that \Venus, the benefic, and one or more triplicity rulers are together in a bad place.}.''
