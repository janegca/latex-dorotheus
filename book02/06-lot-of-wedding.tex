\section{Lot of Wedding by Day or Night}

The Lot of Wedding is from the \Sun\, to the \Moon\, (from night, the \Moon\, to the \Sun) projected from \Venus.

\Jupiter\, square or opposed to the lot indicates marriage.

If the lot opposes the Ascendant, or is in the 4th aspected by malefics, or if the triplicity ruler of \Venus\, (in a man's chart) or \Mars\, (in a woman's chart) is in the 4th or 7th, then, the spouse will die.

\Venus\, in the 4th or 7th in a man's chart not only indicates the spouse's death but also the man's ``smallness of...constancy toward women.''

\Venus\, western with or aspected by a malefic, in a man's chart, also indicates the wife will die.

In a man's chart, \Jupiter\, in the 10th or 8th aspecting \Venus\, in the 6th or 12th indicates marriage to a good woman who will die, causing ``fear and weeping and anxiety'' for the man.

``But your consideration concerning the time of their [the women's] death [should] be as I told you in the matter of the parents (\S1.15) and brothers (\S1.19-21).''
