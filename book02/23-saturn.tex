\section{Saturn in the Places}
\textsc{Ascendant} \hfill \\
\indent In its own places in a diurnal chart ``\Saturn\, will have no harm because he will be a lord of landed estates and buildings'' according to the level of rank or status as indicated by the chart;however, ``he will be weak in body, conspicuous in diseases, [and] he will not attain complete nobility, but he will be mediocre, he will not profit in the matter of marriage, and he will leave his parents.''

If \Saturn\, is the places of his enemies\footnote{In his detriment (\Cancer,\Leo) or detriment (\Aries), or possibly in \Scorpio, or peregrine.} ``it will be more injurious because his reputation will become bad and his children will be few; in a nocturnal nativity it will be worse because he will have difficulty in affairs, [will be] tormented by diseases, ugly in [actual] appearance and [in] rumor, secretive, injurious in nature and [to] most of the things which are near [him, and children] will not be born to them nor will they love their relatives.''

Other planets in the 7th while \Saturn\, is in the 1st indicate:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[\Jupiter] his older brothers will die before him and ``he will fall into the hand[s] of his enemies.''

\item[\Mars] ``abundant evil and a bad death for the native and [his] parents.''

\item[\Venus] the death of the person's wife.

\item[\Mercury] his parents may die suddenly
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textsc{Midheaven} \hfill \\
\indent\Saturn\, here mars the person's livelihood and good fortune for thirty years, especially in a nocturnal nativity, in a fixed sign. In a mutable sign, the person will do better but his good fortune will be slight. 

If \Saturn\, is in the 10th with \Mars\, the person will come to a bad end unless a benefic is in the 7th.

\indent ``Indicates the death of [his] children and brothers or their paucity, and he will be heavy in [his] body, diseased, and injury will come to him fro the sea or [from] water or from the coldness of his limbs, and his death will be a terrible death, but also he will see what he loves in his enemies.''

``If \Mercury\, is with \Saturn, then it will be worse in the matter of his children and his slaves and his servants, and his good fortune and his property will be spoiled.''
