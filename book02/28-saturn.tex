\item[\Jupiter] ``it indicates a good condition and honor, and he will raise the children of others, and he will be a steward, and he will love his wife and will be one of those who love nobles together with a goodness of livelihood; it indicates similarly in \Jupiter's term''

\item[\Mars] ``he will be difficult in his own and in other's work''

\item[\Venus] ``there is no good in the matter of marriage because he will marry a young girl or an old woman or a whore, or grief and misery will come to him because of women, and some of them will come to fornication in order to acquire its fee''

\item[\Mercury] ``he will be secretive, and will love silence except that he will be reasonable, learned in the secret of books, and injury will come to him for this reason, and his tongue will not be distinct or clear''

\item[\Moon] ``he will destroy his mother's property and robe it in her lifetime, and his mother will be sick, and her limbs will complain of the cold and the black bile and the harsh pain until she shall make a vow for herself to a house of worship''

\item[\Sun] ``his father will be praiseworthy [and] will increase in his livelihood, but besides this his father will complain of dampness or will die a terrible death''
