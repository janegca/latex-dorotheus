\section{Lot of Transit with respect to Children}
The birth of children is timed by the activation of a lot taken from \Jupiter\, to \Mars\, by day or from \Mars\, to \Jupiter\, by night and projected from the Ascendant.

A child will be born when \Jupiter\, or \Venus\, or \Saturn\, transits the lot, its square or opposition. 

Children may also be born when the year comes to the place (sign)  containing \Jupiter\, or \Venus.
