\begin{description}[style=multiline,leftmargin=1.5cm]
\item[\Saturn\Opposition\Jupiter]
``there will be no good in his condition or his work, and he will grieve for his children. If \Saturn\, is in the ascendent and \Jupiter\, in the West, then in the beginning of his years he will be miserable but i their end happy''

\item[\Saturn\Opposition\Mars] 
the person will have ``misery and misfortune in [his] livelihood and grief and disease and harm and a decrease in his life and a paucity of children and an abundance of enemies and distress and a struggle concerning what is between him and his relatives and a quick death for his father and misery on top of misery. 

If these two planets are in a wet place, then this native will be miserable in streams and the sea or near this, and diseases from dampness will reach him so that he will be harmed in his body. 

If it is in a quadruped sign, then injury and biting will reach him from lions or he will be poisoned at the end of his life. If these two are in quartile (\Square), it indicates approximately this or whatever of falling may come to the native until he sees that he is dying, and it is worse for him if the two malefics are injured by the \Moon\, without the aspect of \Jupiter. 

If they are both, together with this, in cardines, then this is an indication of death in separation from his relatives and his country, and some of them will tumble from the good or fall into the hands of the people. But if they are both in what follows the cardines, one of them in opposition to the other, it indicates the end of hope and destruction, especially if it is in a feminine sign.

If both are in cadents, then there will be less for the evil of these two, but according to this the native will fall and [this] will sadden him, but if the \Sun\, aspects it dissipates this injury''

\item[\Saturn\Opposition\Sun] without an aspect from \Jupiter, ``it indicates trouble for his father in [his] livelihood and chronic illness, and the spoiling of his father's property---if his father dies he will quickly spoil his property---and his death will be a bad death, and the native will fall upon evil, especially if it is in a feminine sign''

\item[\Saturn\Opposition\Venus] ``he will be excessive in fornication, a disgraced man, and he will not marry; if he does marry, he will marry a disgraced songstress or a stranger or one in whom there is a chronic illness or a servant or one in whom there is sickness, and joy will not reach [him] in the acts of \Venus''

\item[\Saturn\Opposition\Mercury] ``it indicates a stammer of the tongue and few words, or he will be a lisper, especially if \Mercury\, is in a sign which has no voice (\Cancer, \Scorpio, \Pisces) and is under the \Sun's rays and with this aspects the \Moon. If \Mars\, aspects it, it diminishes from these evils but increases [his] trouble; but he will be perfect in intellect [and] sedate, but no gain will reach him from his intellect and his reason except that he will be learned, stuffed with intelligence, and because of this he will be good in rank because, even if he is younger than they, his older [brothers] will die and he will be their leader, and his father will die before his mother''

\item[\Saturn\Opposition\Moon]
``it indicates the spoiling of his mother's property and pain and hidden illness and grief and irritation. If a benefic does not aspect
it, it indicates a blemish in his mother's body and badness of condition in the matter of livelihood. 

If it is in a quadruped sign, it indicates injury from lions. If it is in one of the signs which resembles a human, this evil will reach him. 

If the sign is wet, then [the injury] is from water and streams and diseases. 

If the benefics do not make it ineffectual, it indicates chronic illness in his body and darkness in [his] two eyes, and some of them will  live exiled from their city''

\end{mdframed}

\item[\Jupiter\Opposition\Mars] \textsl{``there will be unevenness in life and a loss of wealth, as well as hostility from friends, and dangers from rash actions''}

\item[\Jupiter\Opposition\Sun] \textsl{``there will be a loss of the father's assets, and he will fall from a previous honor, with lesser people being preferred to him, and it is worse in a nocturnal nativity''}

\item[\Jupiter\Opposition\Venus] \textsl{``it indicates promotion, advancement, good fortune, and wealth; but also unfaithfulness and disagreements from friends, and their friends are ungrateful''}

\item[\Jupiter\Opposition\Mercury] \textsl{``the native will be trained in speech, but it also indicates insurrection and strife from the people, that envy from others will harm their reputation among kings, and also the death of siblings or conflict between them''}

\item[\Jupiter\Opposition\Moon] if the \Moon\, is waxing and west of the \Sun\, in the evening the person ``will be celebrated with respect to [his] livelihood, a famous man, and he will be one of those who relies on himself and will not obey another, especially if the \Moon\, is less in degrees than \Jupiter. 

If the \Moon\, is greater in degrees, then it is harmful because [there will be] a decrease in [his] livelihood [and] afflictions and agony will come to him''

\item[\Mars\Opposition\Sun] ``in a diurnal nativity, it indicates a horrible death for the native's father or a decrease in his sight, and the native will fall from a lofty place and afflictions will come to him; in a nocturnal nativity his work will be slight and his property will be dissipated''

\item[\Mars\Opposition\Venus] the person ``will be one of those in whom there is no constancy with respect to [his] thinking, and it will harm his father and his marriage. If it is in a tropical sign (\Cancer, \Capricorn), it indicates quarreling and misfortune because of women''

\item[\Mars\Opposition\Mercury] the person ``will have little shame [but will be] a master of lies and books or bewitchment and injury, and his livelihood will be from this, and he will have little property, but his wife will be good, and he will not cease being surety and giving guarantees for it, but he will run away from the discharge of [his] trust, and he will submit it to the judges and to argument, and fear will come to him and dread of [his] superiors, and he will depart for places in a land other than his own, especially if \Mercury\, is in \Saturn's term or in in its own term or house''

\item[\Mars\Opposition\Moon] the person's ``life will be short, and as long as he stays alive [it will be] in misery and calamity, and some of them will die before they marry and some of them will die a terrible death, and he will be discontent and his limbs will be cut off or tied up''
