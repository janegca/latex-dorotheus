\section{Children}
If \Jupiter's 1st and 2nd triplicity rulers are together in a good place, rising from the \Sun, then the person will have, and benefit from, children.

If one of the rulers is in a good place and the other in a bad place the person will have children ``but misery and lamentation and weeping will reach him because of them.'' And the timing is shown as usual, by the first part of life being given to the 1st triplicity ruler, the 2nd part of life to the second triplicity ruler.

If both triplicity rulers are angular and USB then the person will have no children, especially if \Jupiter\, is cadent and USB\footnote{Possible if \Jupiter\, and its tripliclity rulers are all are within 15Â° of the \Sun\, and in neighbouring signs.}.
