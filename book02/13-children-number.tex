\section{Number of Male and Female Children}
If a feminine sign is the fifth place\footnote{Not sure of this, Dorotheus says ``look at the place which I mentioned to you and its lord'', the fifth seems to be most logical choice.} and its ruler is in a masculine sign, the person will have more male children than female. If the place is masculine and the ruler is in a feminine sign, then there will be more female children.

If the \Moon\, is angular in an equatorial sign (\Aries, \Libra) it indicates sterility for both men and women.

When \Jupiter\, transits, squares, opposes, or trines radix \Mars\, the spouse is pregnant.
