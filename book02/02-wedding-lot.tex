\section{The Lot of Wedding}

The Lot of the Wedding \textsl{([Marriage])} is counted from \Saturn\, to \Venus\, by day, the reverse by night, and projected from the Ascendant. If either of those planets is in the lot or in square to it, ``then this is the indicator of the wedding.''

If a malefic or an angle of the lot falls in the 6th or 12th then there will be grief and little benefit from the wedding.
