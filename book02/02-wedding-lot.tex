\section{The Lot of Wedding (Man's)}

The Lot of the Wedding \textsl{([Marriage])} is counted from \Saturn\, to \Venus\, by day, the reverse by night, and projected from the Ascendant. Those planets in the lot or square to it become ``the indicator of the wedding.''

If a malefic or an angle of the lot falls in the 6th or 12th then there will be grief and little benefit from the marriage.
