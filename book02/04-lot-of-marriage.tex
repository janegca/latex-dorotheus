\section{Lot of Marriage}
\subsection{Indications for Marriage}
\begin{itemize}
\item \Venus's triplicity ruler in its own place
\item \Venus\, in one of her own places indicates a marriage that will ``abound in children''

\item the ruler of the lot of marriage ``rejoicing in its light\footnote{The planet is diurnal, in a day time chart, above the horizon in the same hemisphere as the \Sun, or, it is nocturnal, in a night chart, in the hemisphere above the horizon which does not include the \Sun.}, aspecting its own place while the benefics aspect it, and its place is strong in a cardine or what follows a cardine, then this native will marry a good woman with no blemish in her, virtuous, praiseworthy in this, and he will be noble in his condition and his benefit''. The benefit, as shown by the ruler, is from:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[\Jupiter] nobles
		\item[\Saturn] the spouse's paternal inheritance or a freed slave
		\item[\Mars] violent deeds or the works of a martial man
		\item[\Mercury] calculation and words
		\item[\Venus] praise, women and females
	\end{itemize}

\item if \Mercury\, is the ruler of the lot marriage and it is in a bad place while a benefic is in or aspects that place then the person will marry a virtuous wife and good wife but he ``will be anxious and unhappy.'' If \Mercury's dispositor is in a good place the ``misery and misfortune because of women'' will pass or they will ``attain joy and profit'' because of it

\item \Venus\, in \Libra, indicates more than one marriage, especially if other planets aspect the place
\item \Venus\, in the 7th (an angle) the person will marry but ``it indicates injury and misery and calamity because of women and that he will have little stability with them'' and he will have intercourse with servants, poor and needy women, and strangers.
\item \Venus\, in the 4th indicates marriage but with grief due to the wife and child dying and it is worse if \Venus\, is in a cardinal sign, especially \Cancer\, or \Capricorn, as it indicates a strong desire for intercourse with disgraced women and whores and debts because of this
\item \Saturn\, with \Venus\, or \Venus\, in the terms of \Saturn\, while \Saturn\, aspects her, the person will marry a widow or an older woman or one who does not care for him or an insignificant or disgraced woman and the same applies in a woman's chart with respect to a husband and children
\item \Venus\, with \Mars\, or in in the terms of \Mars\, while \Mars\, aspects then the spouse will be an adulterer and there will be grief due to a lack of children through barrenness or sterility

\item \Venus\, with \Jupiter\, combust indicates an obscure marriage and the person will marry a widow whose childbearing years are over
\item \Venus\, with the \Moon\, in \Cancer\, or \Taurus, in the aspect of \Jupiter, the person marries a female relative

\item \Venus\, in a bad place \Conjunction\Moon, or \Venus\, \Square\, or \Opposition\, the \Moon, indicates harm to the marriage and if two are angular they indicate marriage to a sister or close female relative

\item \Venus\, and the \Moon\, together in the 4th in the aspect of \Jupiter\, indicates marriage to a relative and children in their later years

\item the ruler of the lot of marriage in the lot, aspecting the lot, or aspecting the \Moon\, indicates marriage to a relative, possibly a niece or nephew

\item \Saturn\, and \Venus\, in the Ascendant in one of \Taurus, \Libra, \Capricorn\, or \Aquarius\, indicates sex with a daughter or older sister but if the \Moon\, is square to them, the sex is with a maternal aunt; if \Mars, rather than the \Moon\, is square them, then he will marry a woman but lose his property because of her and if it is the chart of a woman, she is a lesbian

\item the ruler of the lot of marriage in the 7th place from the lot while the ruler of that place is in the lot indicates the person ``will keep quiet about their marriage[s] and will have intercourse with women secretly, then they will marry them after that and they will have children''
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Indications against Marriage}

The lot of marriage \Opposition\Venus\, or \Opposition\ASC\, or in a bad place or if \Venus\, is in a masculine sign in the eastern hemisphere the person will be without a woman for his entire life because \Venus\, is a nocturnal planet who rejoices in the western hemisphere and prefers feminine (nocturnal) signs. Diurnal planets rejoice in the eastern hemisphere and prefer masculine (diurnal) signs.

If \Venus's triplicity rulers do not aspect \Venus\, or the midheaven, ``then men will have no pleasure in marriage.''

The person will never marry if the triplicity rulers of the lot aspect neither the lot nor \Venus\, nor the midheaven.

If \Venus's triplicity ruler is in the last degrees of a sign or in the terms of a malefic or in the 4th or not in its own place or is aspected by malefics then the person will never marry.

If \Venus\, is in a bad place in the aspect of \Saturn\, with \Jupiter\, aspecting neither the place nor \Saturn, then the person will never marry but ``he will have intercourse with those who are disgraced and in whom there is no good.''

If \Venus\, and \Mars\, are in the other's house or term or if they are  conjunct, square or opposed to each other it indicates ``debauchery and wickedness'' and if they are in the western hemisphere it will be secret but if in the eastern hemisphere the debauchery will be public and if the \Sun\, aspects there will be infamy and if with this \Mercury\, rules the lot of marriage and is located in the 6th or a quadrupedal sign while the lot of marriage is also in a quadrupedal sign and injured, the person will not marry young or if they do it will not last as these usually work their lives away without marriage and if the ruler of the lot of wedding is in a good place ``he will have intercourse with a sick woman, or a stranger who has no one, and trouble and injury will come upon him because of the''

\subsection{Other Indications}
\begin{itemize}
\item \Venus\, peregrine or in a tropical sign with or in the aspect of the \Moon\, or if \Saturn\, aspects, will be willing to pay for sex

\item the ruler of the lot of marriage USB or under the earth while it aspects the lot indicates ``intercourse with whores and slave girls or he will have intercourse with one with whom a multitude of men has had intercourse''

\end{itemize}
