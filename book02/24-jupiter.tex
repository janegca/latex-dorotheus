\indent The person ``will possess a good marriage and children and brothers and reputation, especially in a diurnal nativity,'' less so in a nocturnal nativity.

The father is better than the mother if \Jupiter\, is in a masculine sign and the reverse if \Jupiter\, is in a feminine sign and, if it is in a mutable, sign the person ``will raise up his parents\footnote{Dykes sames he will be ``named'' for his parents; he believes Pingree's reading, which implies the person will raise their parent's status, is a misreading (CAD p.163 fn1).}''

If, at the same time, \Saturn\, is in the 7th, his father will be harmed and his holder siblings will be destroyed and ``he will see what he loves in his enemies together with praise and condmenation, and he will be in the houses of worship and the houses of kings entrusted with a throng of people.'' \Mars\, in the 10th or 11th ``will diminish this or spoil it in the end.''

If \Mars, rather than \Saturn, is in the 7th the person will be superior to his enemies and his superiority will be even better if \Venus\, witnesses \Jupiter\, and more so again if the \Moon\, is also involved with them.

\indent The person ``will be far out in his fame, noble, having good fortune and children, especially in a diurnal nativity.'' And if \Mars\, is in a good place and ``in his own portion\footnote{Dykes has ``in his own share'' meaning ``in his own sect'' p.164 fn2. Although ``portion'' could possibly mean ``term'' or ``bound'' as the Greeks used ``portion'' for ``degree.''}, then he will be one of the chiefs and lords of armies, well known [and] praiseworthy.''

``If \Venus\, aspects, it will increase his good fortune because of women, and he will be praiseworthy [and] famous.

If \Mercury\, aspects from a good place, it will increase [his] learning and reason and intelligence.''

\indent The person's condition and status will be better when he is older, ``and his end will be good, but it is better if \Jupiter\, is in his own house or exaltation, but he will be troubled and miserable in his youth and he will see the death of his women and his brothers, especially if a malefic aspects it or is with it, but he will have work and medical treatment in the houses of kings and of chiefs, and he will be a lord of property and goods from what he attains of power, and his reputation will grow, and, if he dies, he will leave behind a good name and a pleasing reputation.''

``If the West \textsl{[7th]} is a tropical sign, then he will rise up and escape from his neighborhood and rob kings and spoil the property of his fathers, especially if a malefic aspects it (we have seen [people] like this who were lords and leaders, [but] then were expelled from their properties [and were] empty), and one of them will be consoled with a woman servant or a foreign woman or one who is worse in [her] lineage than is he.

If \Jupiter\, aspects \Venus\, and \Mercury\, and \Mars\, while the \Moon\, is with it, it indicates debauchery and misfortune and misery.

If \Venus\, aspects \Jupiter\, ``while both of them aspect the \Moon, then he will be learned, a fortune-teller, [and] will predict things before they happen.''

\indent The person will have success from ``an act of secrecy, and the native will rise, and his control over his property and his good will improve, and the condition of his parents will be better, but [there will be] no good in his marriage, or he will marry at the end of his life and [children] will be born to him at the end of his years or their middle, and he will fall in the middle of his years from his good fortune, [but] then he will get up and his affairs will prosper.''
