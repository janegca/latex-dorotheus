\section{The Sun in the Places}
\textsc{Asc or MC:} \\
\indent If the \Sun\, is ``in its own house or a male sign, then it will be good. 

If the benefics aspect it from the tenth place, he will be praiseworthy, a leader over groups in nobility; and it indicates similarly if it is in the midheaven except that he will have few brothers.''

\noindent{7th:}\\
\indent ``[I]ndicates hidden misery for his parents and his brothers.

If \Mercury\, is with it, then he will abound in property, especially if \Mercury\, is western\footnote{As they are already in the west, in the 7th, this most likely means \Mercury\, is \textsl{western} of the \Sun, setting after it sets.}.''

If the \Sun\, is not in its own places and is aspected by malefics, especially in the opposition or square of \Mars, it ``indicates terror because of fire or a terrible death or evil rising up in him or a [bad] name or yelling or murder arises, and some of them will be food for lions; if the \Moon\, is injured, then it will be worse, but if the benefics aspect they will diminish the misery.''

\noindent{4th:} \\
\indent A fall is indicated or ``a decrease in the property of his fathers, but if the lord of its house or its exaltation overpower it, it will ameliorate this evil\footnote{Here he seems to be saying that if the domicile or exaltation ruler of the \Sun\, is square from the 1st (the 10th from the 4th) it lessens the harm. A trine ``from the right'' or 9th place of a sign can also be said to ``overcome'' or ``overpower'' the aspected planet so in this case, a trine from the domicile or exaltation ruler from the 12th (9th from the 4th) may also lessen the evil, possibly by harming others (12th is a cadent house) rather than the native himself. Angular houses usually effect the person, succedent houses, the person and others, cadent houses, effect the person indirectly via other people, especially if an exalted planet is involved, they tend to deflect the harm onto others.}.''
