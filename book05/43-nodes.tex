\section{On clarifying the phases of the Moon and its nodes}

The head is called the "ascending" and its tail the "descending", and the signs said to be "obscured" are from \Leo\ to \Capricorn, which is the region of descent, while from \Aquarius\ to \Cancer\ is the region of ascent. 

If the \Moon\ is in the region of ascent increasing in motion, then he who buys at this time will buy dearly and at an increase in its price over what is right.

If the \Moon\ is in the region of descent and is slowing in motion, then he who buys at this time will buy cheaply and at a price less than what is right.

Look at the \Moon's phase. If it is emerging from under the \Sun's rays until it reaches the left square of the \Sun\, he benefits from those who's intention it is to buy and to sell sincerely and faithfully as he who buys at this time buys the commodity for a price that is right and in which there is neither cheapness nor expensiveness.

When the \Moon\ goes from the left square of the \Sun\ until it reaches the opposition of the \Sun, then selling benefits from this and commencing a litigation. 

When it moves from the the opposition of the \Sun\ until it reaches the right square of the \Sun, then buying benefits from this and what is properly sought.

When the \Moon\ moves from the right square of the \Sun\ until it reaches the \Sun's position, then the people whose intention is proper and just benefit from this.
