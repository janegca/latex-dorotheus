\section{Judgment according to the crooked and the straight}
See if the sign rising at \textsl{``each commencement''} is straight or crooked.

If the rising sign is straight and it holds a malefic or a malefic aspects it, then the going will be slow and there will be ``misery and misfortune'' along with ``trouble and pain''.

If the rising sign is crooked and it holds a benefic or a benefic is in aspect to it; they will help bring the action to a successful conclusion.

If the rising sign contains, or is aspected by, both benefics and malefics, there will be mixed results, both good and bad.

\textsl{Straight} signs are of ``long'' ascension as they take two hours or more to rise and they are seen to rise `straight up'; near to a right-angle from the horizon. \textsl{Crooked} signs rise at an oblique angle to the horizon, taking less than two hours to rise and so are of ``short'' ascension.

\textsl{Straight} signs indicate slow actions but ``direct'' paths; it's clear to see where the action is leading; while \textsl{crooked} signs indicate ``quick'' actions but along an ``unclear'' or ``indirect'' path; it's not always clear what the action is leading.
