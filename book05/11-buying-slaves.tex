\section{The buying of slaves}
When buying a slave, the sign the  \Moon\, or the Ascendent occupies (when they are not with a malefic or benefic or in aspect to one) indicates:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[\Aries] the slave will be a runaway who will not get used to his station and who will be incompatible with his master
\item[\Taurus] he will be a worker, patient, strong, obedient, sticking to the work of a slave with his whole self, a humble man
\item[\Gemini] if the \Moon\, is in the last degrees of \Gemini\,\footnote{Dykes notes that Hephaistio equates the last degrees to the 3rd face of \Gemini\, (20-29Â°)(p243n52)} indications are the same as for \Taurus
\item[\Cancer] they will be weak, lazy, unreliable, [and] putrid [?]
\item[\Leo] he will be a master, trained for [his] craft, educated, good in the goodness of his upbringing, except that he will be wrathful, abounding in food, and he will be frivolous and a pain in [his] belly and stomach will not cease happening to him because of this, and he will be an embezzler of things
\item[\Virgo] he will be uncommon, a custodian, a worker, a sincere adviser to his master
\item[\Libra] he will be dedicated to his work, knowledgeable in the work, a legist with respect to religion and quarrels
\item[\Scorpio] he will be a thief [and] a runaway
\item[\Sagittarius] the basis for buying him will not be good, but he will be a master in whom [there is] vanity and admiration for himself
\item[\Capricorn] he will be a liar and will not cease himself changing over from [one] situation to [another] situation, and there will be some of them who will make a habit of running away
\item[\Aquarius]  he will be a lover of work, a good man, and this is because \Aquarius\, is in the figure of a man
\item[\Pisces]  he will be a slanderer and will conceal in himself disloyalty to his master and calumny to him
\end{itemize}

But then Dorotheus tells us to \textsl{``Look concerning the condition of the seven and their power as they are far stronger than the signs.''}
