\section{Taking medicine or a remedy}
	If you want a medicine or remedy for the nose, or sickness in the head, or diarrhea to work then begin when the \Moon\, is waxing and in \Aries\, or \Taurus, which \textsl{``two signs magnify and are called the `region of ascent'''} and it is best if the benefics also aspect the \Moon.
	
	If the medicine is for diarrhea or stomach upset, and is an enema or drink, it is best to take the medicine when the \Moon\, is in \Libra\, or \Scorpio\, \textsl{``as these place[s] compress and are called the `regions of lowness'}, and it is best if the benefics also aspect the \Moon.
