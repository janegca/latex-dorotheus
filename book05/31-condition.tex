\section{The condition of someone who's sick}
If you want to know the condition a sick person form whom death and misfortunes are feared, look at his nativity at the time he takes ill, and see in which signs the malefics and benefics were. 

If the \Moon\, \textsl{``in its course and its transit''} is in a sign occupied by a malefic in the nativity and the malefics aspect the transit \Moon\,  from square while the benefics do not aspect by transit or in the nativity then it indicates the illness will be hideous and he will not escape from it and it will be worse if time-distributor without the lord of the limit has also arrived in the same sign.\footnote{Think this means that if the transit \Moon\, and/or the radix \Moon\, are being aspected by malefics without the aspect of a benefic things won't go well. Dykes, in a footnote, thinks the ``time-distributor'' is the profected Ascendant and the ``lord of the limit'' is the term lord currently active by ``direction through the bounds''.}

If the time-distributor has arrived at this sign, or a sign like it, one aspected by \Saturn\, or \Mars\, in the nativity, then it indicates a hideous illness he will not escape.

The disease or pains in the body will be according to the sign.

If the \Moon\, is in a two-bodied sign, especially \Gemini\, or \Pisces, while \Saturn\, and \Mars\, are with it, enclosing it, and if the time-distributor arrives at the aspect of \Saturn\, and \Mars, then it indicates that gout will reach this native in his two hands and his two feet.
