\section{Will property increase or decrease?}
If you want to know when the property of the native will increase or decrease, then look at the second sign from the ascendant which is the house of property. If the distributor of the time is in this sign while the malefics are in it or aspecting it by square or opposition then the native's property will be diminished.

If the benefics are there or aspecting it while the distributor is in the term of one of the benefics, \textsl{then it indicates that the native's property and his happiness will increase''}.
