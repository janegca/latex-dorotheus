\section{The buying of animals}
If they animal being bought is tamed, used and/or obedient it is best to make the purchase when the Ascendent is in \Aries\, or in \Taurus\, if the \Moon\, is also in \Taurus.

If the animal is not tamed and not used, it is best to make the purchase when the Ascendent and \Moon\, are in the last degrees of \Leo\, or \Sagittarius.
