\section{The journey}
If someone wants to travel to another land, examine the Asc for the traveller, the 7th for the land they want to visit, the 10th for what is hoped for from the journey, and the 4th for the outcome.

The best time to leave is when the \Moon\, is waxing, not USB and not in the 12th or 6th. Also check to make sure the rulers of the Asc and the \Moon\, are not cadent and \Mercury\, is not USB.

The \Moon\, in the 6th or 12th would indicate \textsl{``that misfortune and pain and misery will happen to him on his journey.''}

A waxing \Moon\, would indicate \textsl{``he will come to the place which he desires in comfort.''}

If the benefics are in the ascendent, \textsl{``then it indicates goodness with respect to the condition of that journey.''}

If the benefics are in the 7th, \textsl{``then it indicates his profit from his departure to that land which he desires.''}

If the \Moon\, and \Saturn\, or \Mars\, or all three are together in the ascendent or the 7th, \textsl{``then it indicates that a severe pain and an oppressive disease and damage and shouting and fighting will happen to him on his journey and [in] the land which he comes to.}

If the ruler of the Asc or the \Moon\, is stationing, \textsl{``then it indicates his absence will be long and there will occur slowness and difficulty in his affair.''}

If either benefic is \Square, \Opposition, or with the \Moon, then \textsl{``the commencement of the journey will be good.''}. If a malefic is \Square, or \Opposition\, to the \Moon\, then \textsl{``the commencement of this journey will be bad.''}
