\section{The courtship and separation from a woman}
The full title of this section is \textsl{``The courtship of a woman, and what occurs between a wife and her husband when she quarrels and scolds and departs from her house publicly''}, Dorotheus then says \textsl{``if you want to know, if she returns to him, whether he will profit from her or will see joy and happiness or other than this in her, then look at the hour in which you are asked about this at the position of the \Sun\, and \Venus.''}

If \mn{2} the \Sun\, is in the 10th or 11th while \Venus\, is retrograde and western\footnote{``Western'' here could mean ``west of the \Sun'' i.e. rising after the \Sun, or, being in the western hemisphere. I'm inclined to think it means ``west of the \Sun'' because the \Sun\, is the other planet we are told to look at.} \textsl{``then it indicates that this woman will return to the house of her husband and will not cease being obedient to her husband from the day she returns [and] she will not contradict [him], but the husband will be blessed with profit and good and joy from her.''}

If \mn{3}, instead, \Venus\, is \textsl{``cadent from the cardines in a double place\footnote{Think this occurs when \Venus\, is in the same sign as the \Sun\, but she is physically in the 9th or 12th and so cadent and in a ``double place'' i.e. both planets in \Pisces\, with the MC at 10 \Pisces\, and \Venus\, at 5 \Pisces\, in the 9th or the \Sun\, at 15 \Pisces\, in the 11th but with the 12th at 18 \Pisces\, and \Venus\, in the 12th at 20 \Pisces.}, then it is necessary that he be diligent in seeking the woman whom he courts as profit and joy will come to him from her.''}

If \mn{6}, when the woman leaves her husband's house, \Venus\, is in the 10th or 11th \textsl{while the \Sun\, is below the horizon or in a double place which is a cadent, then predict similarly about the weakness of the man and the strength of the woman.''}

If \mn{4-5} the \Sun\, and \Venus\, are together in a strong place\footnote{The text actually ``If the \Sun\, and \Venus\, are together in a strong place, then it indicates like this.'' I've melded this with the sentence that follows on the assumption that ``like this'' refers to the next sentence but I may well be wrong and it simply means that both the man and woman are ``strong'' like their significators.} and \Venus\, is direct in motion, \textsl{``then it indicates that the woman who departs from her house will subjugate her husband so that for this reason estrangement and separation will come between the two of them, and it indicates that the man will repent after the separation, and it will be thus in the case of the woman who is courted.''}

If \mn{7} the woman departs when the \Moon\, opposes the \Sun, \textsl{``it indicates that this woman will not be devoted to her husband except after pain and suffering.''}

If \mn{8} the woman leaves when the \Moon\, is applying to the \Sun, then \textsl{``it indicates that the woman will soon return to her husband and her house in other than pain and without afflictions.''}

If \mn{9-10} \Venus\, is retrograde or direct but \textsl{``in the West''}\footnote{In the 7th?} when the woman leaves then \textsl{``her return to her house will be quick. [and] she will be cheerful but will repent for what there was of her departure and will experience great shame for this.''} If at the this time you find \Venus\, \textsl{``departing from the [\Sun's] rays and it is western, then it indicates like this concerning her return because she will not cease repenting until she returns.''}

In the matter of marriage, always check \mn{11-14} the \Moon\, and the sign it is in; if they are both injured, \textsl{``then there will be shouting and discord and hostility and separation between the man and the woman, and the two [of them] will not settle upon anything and will not be reconciled; thus it indicates the subject of friendship and love.''} And look at the power of the benefics, if they are strong and in good positions, \textsl{``the conflict and estrangement and evil will disappear and there will be peace and agreement and good between them, if God---be He exalted!---wishes.''}
