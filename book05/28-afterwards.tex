\section{Judgment about what may not be afterwards of a matter which one hopes for, or according to this of things}
If the query is about \textsl{``what will not be afterwards, but [that] which is''} or if it's about \textsl{``a thing one hopes for''} or an action that has not yet begun, look at the conjunction of the \Moon\, and its ``flowing away'' (separating) in ``quartile''.

If the query is about escape from pain or disease or imprisonment or flight, look at the planet the \Moon\, is separating from as the conjunction indicates \textsl{``what is to come of matters''} and ``flowing away'' (separating) indicates \textsl{``what has been and is passed''}\footnote{Dkyes thinks Dorotheus is trying to express the idea that ``separation'' shows the current condition and the next planet the \Moon\, contacts ``will show the result of the future action.''}.
