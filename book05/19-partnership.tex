\section{Partnership}
If \mn{1} you want to form a partnership with another man for any reason, check the \Moon\, for the same conditions mentioned under marriage i.e.that she is in a good sign for marriage and free from any impediments.

The indications from the Ascendant and the \Moon\, in the signs are as follows as long as they are not with or in the aspect of either benefics or malefics:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[\Aries] the partnership will not last as there will soon be estrangements and separation between the two
\item[\Taurus] there will be no good in the outcome as a partnership with a powerful man will be dangerous and if it is with lowly persons there will be discords
\item[\Gemini] the partnership will be good and both will profit by it; there will be agreement and the preservation of trust between the two
\item[\Cancer] each will slander the other and there will be betrayal and anxiety in both
\item[\Leo] there will be profit and a good reputation for both
\item[\Virgo] there will be a good profit and wise men will praise them both, and they will have affection among the people and will attain much profit, surplus, and joy from their trading
\item[\Libra] there will be no good in the partnership
\item[\Scorpio] there will be quarrelling and discord between the two and they will both conceal their disloyalty and slander of the other
\item[\Sagittarius] the partnership will be good but each will act arrogantly toward the other
\item[\Capricorn] happiness and joy will occur to both
\item[\Aquarius] misfortune and injury will occur to both
\item[\Pisces] the partnership will be elevated and good
\end{itemize}

Indications from the planets with or aspecting the Ascendant or the \Moon:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[\Saturn] they will not agree on any advice, ad whatever of love was between them will cool down, and there will be shouting and discord between them, and misery and separation and upheaval and slowness in work regardless of how long they have known each other
\item[\Mars] if \Mars\, is with them or aspects them from a strong place then there will be quarrelling and fighting and discord
\item[\Jupiter] if \Jupiter\, is trine or with the Asc and \Moon\, then profit and good reputation and prestige will occur to them from their partnership but the more amply provided of the two will have the larger share, he will gain two thirds from this profit at the end because the people of good luck and who possess importance are worthier of preferment than others\footnote{I guess the concept of ``meritocracy'' was conceived long before baseball existed; maybe being born near the Acropolis substituted for being born on 3rd base.}
\end{itemize}

Whenever the benefics aspect (whether by sextile, square, trine or opposition) the Asc or \Moon, or are with the Asc or \Moon, the partnership will be good and there will be profit in it but the good and the profit will be best when the benefics aspect by trine.
