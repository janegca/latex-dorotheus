\section{Marriage and matrimony}
\subsection{Basic indications}
The \Sun, the ascendant, and the planet the \Moon\, is separating from give the condition of the man. If the \Sun\, is injured and  \Venus\, is with or aspecting \Jupiter\, \textsl{``then it indicates that this marriage will not be useful to the man, or a misfortune will reach him, but the woman will attain joy and happiness and benefit.''}

The condition of the woman is shown by \Venus, the 7th sign and the planet the \Moon\, is applying to. If \Venus\, is with \Mars\, or \Saturn\, or they aspect \Venus\, \textsl{``then it indicates that misery, and misfortune and shame will come to the woman, and the two [spouses] do not delay that there should be separation and estrangement between them.''}

The 10th shows \textsl{whatever of agreement or irritation or good or evil will occur between the man and the woman.''}

The 4th shows the outcome of the matter and what is handed over as a dowry or other things.

If the \Moon\, is injured, \textsl{``then evil and misfortune occur to these two together, the man and the woman, from this marriage.''}

If \Mercury\, is with or in the aspect of the benefics, \textsl{``then it indicates that a child will soon be born to these two.''}

If the \Moon\, or \Venus\, is in a tropical sign, \textsl{``then the marriage will have no good in it as it indicates that this woman is a whore, a harlot who will secretly frequent the beds of men.''}

If the \Moon\, is in a tropical sign, \textsl{``then this marriage will not be good for the man or for the woman as there will be no agreement between these two and [their] association will ot last long.''}

\subsection{Indications from the Moon's sign}
What the \Moon\, signifies in each sign:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[\Aries] the marriage will have no good in it
\item[\Taurus] if in the beginning or ending degrees\footnote{The beginning is probably the 1st decan, the end, the last decan and the middle the 2nd decan (each decan is 10Â°).}, the woman will be disloyal to her husband; in the middle degrees, the marriage will be good
\item[\Gemini] in the first half, the marriage will not be good but if the \Moon\, is in the second half, it will be good
\item[\Cancer] avoid marriage when the \Moon\, is in \Cancer\footnote{Why? will the woman be too strong?}
\item[\Leo] the marriage will be good but the pair will spoil and waste each others property as well as the property of others
\item[\Virgo] if the marriage is to a widowed woman there will be good in it but if to a virgin, it will not be good
\item[\Libra] the courtship and engagement will be good but not the marriage
\item[\Scorpio] if the \Moon\, is in the first degrees the marriage will be good, \textsl{``but it will not be good at the end of the sign as the association of these two will not last long''}
\item[\Sagittarius] there will be many kinds of things, but only some of them good; it would be better if the marriage is postponed
\item[\Capricorn] the marriage will not be good if the \Moon\, is in the first degrees; in the middle and end degrees, there will be good in it
\item[\Aquarius] the marriage will have no good at all
\item[\Pisces] the woman will be spoiled\footnote{Not a virgin} and will not cease wronging her husband but it will be a good marriage in all other ways
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Indications from Venus}
If \Venus\, is with malefics or they aspect her, there will be no good in the marriage; \Venus\, and the \Moon\, together are more powerful [for good?].

The marriage will be good, and blessed with children, if \Jupiter\, is overcoming \Venus\, by square\footnote{If \Jupiter\, is in the 10th place from \Venus\, counting in zodiacal order.} while also opposing the \Moon, in which case \Venus\, will be in the 10th from the \Moon\, and so overcoming her.

It is good for the marriage if there is at one trine between the \Moon, \Venus\, and \Jupiter\, but it will be even better if they are in triplicities or signs \textsl{``which abound in children and progeny.''}

If \Venus\, is trine a malefic the husband will be blessed with children \textsl{``when in the revolution of the years the benefics arrive at the place of the malefics in the base[-nativity] or aspect it.''}

\subsection{The likelihood of children}
It is good to look at the nativities of both the man and the woman who are to marry. If each has a benefic in the 10th, then they will have a child in their first coupling, especially if the woman's 10th is in a sign ``abounding with children''.

\subsection{The likely relationship}
If in each nativity you find a benefic in the same place, then it indicates the love of each one for the other. And if you compare the nativities of two men or of two women and you find each has a benefic in the same sign \textsl{``then there will be brotherhood and love and agreement between the two.''}

If the \Moon\, of one nativity is in the sign that falls on the other's ``house of misery'', the 6th, then they will \textsl{``subjugate his companion and tower over him until his companion becomes obedient, [and] it is like the obedience of a slave to his master.''}

It is best to marry when the ascendant and \Moon\, are in a sign which indicates a good marriage while none of the malefics are in the sign or aspecting it.

If the marriage happens when \Venus\, is in a masculine sign and \Jupiter\, is in a feminine sign, the marriage will be better for the man than the woman.

The strongest of what is possible for the marriage is if the \Moon\, is fast in motion and waxing.

If at the time of marriage any of the malefics is with the \Moon\, or in the ascendant, then the two will not agree on any matter and they will not be reconciled and estrangement and discord will come between them.

If the \Moon's in the nativities are in opposing signs i.e. \Moon\, in \Aries\, in one and \Libra\, in the other,  \textsl{``then there will come between the two of them estrangement and discord, and they will not be reconciled nor agree on any matter''} as the opposition indicates hostility. But if both have their \Moon\, above the earth (in the upper hemisphere of their charts) then \textsl{``it indicates that the two of them will come together after the separation, and there will be peace and love between them so that they will be reconciled.''}
