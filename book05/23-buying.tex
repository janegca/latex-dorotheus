\section{Buying a ship or building it}
If you want to buy or a build a ship it best to start when \Jupiter\, or \Venus\, is in the 4th, with both in aspect to the ascendent and the \Moon.

It is best if the sign on the 4th is moist, one of the water signs, or a sign whose nature is one of sea animals or a house of either \Jupiter\, or \Venus. 

It is best when the \Moon\, is in the ascendent and one of \Taurus, \Gemini, \Cancer, \Virgo, \Sagittarius, or the end of \Capricorn\, (which is watery while the beginning is earthy) are on the ascendent. It's also good if the ascendent is \Pisces\, and the \Moon\, is in it.  Although the best is of these is \Taurus, then \Pisces, then Gemini, and then the end of \Capricorn.
