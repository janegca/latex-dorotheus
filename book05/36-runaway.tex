\section{The runaway}
In the matter of a runaway or a fugitive, look at the ascendant and the \Moon\, for the runaway and the \Sun\, and midheaven for the condition of the one seeking the runaway.

If the ascendant and \Moon\, are in tropical signs it indicates the runaway has travelled a distance on land or sea. If in mutable signs, someone else has run away with them. 

If they are in a crooked (short ascension) sign [\Aries,\Taurus,\Gemini,\Capricorn,\Aquarius,\Pisces] then the runaway is confused and strayed from his path or they have been caught. If in a straight (long ascension) sign [\Cancer\, thru \Sagittarius] then the runaway is not confused, will stick to his path and will arrive where he wishes to go. 

If the \Moon\, is not on the equator and is in the first 15° of a mutable sign this is the first time the person has runaway but they will make a habit of it after this. If in the last 15°, the person has runaway before.

If the \Moon\, is in the ascendant, 12th or 11th the runaway is headed East. If in the midheaven,  9th or 8th, they are headed South. If in the 7th, 6th or 5th, they are headed West; in the 4th, 3rd or 2nd, they are headed North.

If \Mars\, is stationary and with or aspecting the \Moon\, then the runaway has shed blood at the place he fled to and has been seized by force or put in chains so he may be sent back to his master or whomever is seeking them.

If \Saturn\, is with or aspecting the \Moon\, then the runaway has raised suspicions or committed a ruse and has fallen in chains because of it. If \Saturn\, is stationary and conjunct the \Moon\, the runaway may strangle themselves unless a benefic aspects, in which case the misfortune will leave them. If \Saturn\, is not stationary when the \Moon\, joins him the runaway has lost any goods he may have stolen before he ran, has wandered and will be seized and sent back to his master in misery and chains.

If the benefics are in the ascendant or aspect the ascendant or are with the \Moon\, then the runaway is truly free. If \Venus\, happens to be in this position the runaway will not be caught but if he is caught and returned he will be content.

If the \Moon\, is increasing the runaway will outrun his searchers; if the \Moon\, is decreasing the runaway will be caught. 

If the \Sun\, is in the sign opposite the ascendant while \Saturn\, is in the 8th sign from the ascendant, the person seeking the runaway will die before the runaway is caught. 

If a malefic is in the midheaven or with the \Sun, then the seeker will have no luck in his search, even he catches the runaway there will be only misery and misfortune to the seeker.

If \Moon\, is in the 7th from the ascendant, without the aspect of a benefic or other relief, and \Mars\, is in the 8th from the ascendant then misfortune and difficulty will reach the runaway and he may die because of it. The same will happen if \Mercury\, (instead of \Mars) is in the 8th and \Mars\, who trines him.

If the \Moon\, is under the \Sun's beams and has not light while \Mars\, aspects the destruction from burning or death by a knife will stop the runaway. To see how the death will come about, look to the sign the \Moon\, occupies as it is USB; if it is human, misfortune will reach the runaway from men; if the signs nature is of a four-footed animal, the misfortune will come from animals; if the sign is in earth, a building will fall on him, if a water sign, he will drown in a flood, and so on with the rest of the signs. If \Mercury\, is with \Saturn\, he will kill himself; if \Venus\, and \Jupiter\, are with \Mercury\, or aspect the \Moon, they will dispel the misfortune, if God wishes, especially if \Jupiter\, and \Venus\, are in their light and their power. 

If the \Moon\, conjoins with \Mars\, in longitude, then beating and imprisonment will reach the runaway; if conjoining in latitude while \Jupiter\, aspects \Mars\, 
  then fear of death will reach him but \Jupiter\, will allow him to escape.
  
If the \Moon\, is in angle with a malefic an unpleasant death will reach the runaway and either his hands or feet will be be cut off. If the \Moon\, is in the midheaven with \Mars\, on his right and \Saturn\, on his left (their signs enclosing the \Moon's sign or their aspects enclosing the \Moon\, by degrees) then the runaway will die by strangulation but if \Saturn\, is on the right and \Mars\, on the left the runaway will be crucified. But if instead the \Sun\, is on the \Moon's left and \Mars\, on the right, the runaway will be burned alive.

The \Moon\, is under the \Sun's rays and ruler of the \Sun's sign does not aspect the \Moon\, then the seeker will die before the runaway is caught. 

If the ascendant, the \Moon\, or the \Moon's dispositor are in a tropical sign (probably \Cancer\, or \Capricorn), the runaway will submissively return to the seeker.

If the \Moon\, aspects both benefics and malefics, if the malefic is square or opposed the \Moon, the runaway will be caught when the \Moon\, reaches the malefic. If he is not caught at that time, he will run into misfortune and difficulties when the \Moon\, reaches the spot where the malefic was. 

If the \Moon\, and the ascendant are injured and not in the aspect of the benefics the runaway, if he does return, will suffer calamity and misfortune. 

If the benefics, in fixed signs, aspect the ascendant and the \Moon\, while they are not also in the aspect of malefics\footnote{The text has `benefics' but that makes no sense; Dykes has  \textsl{``the Ascendant and the Moon are devoid of the aspect of infortunes'' (p305)}}, the runaway will escape. If the benefics are not in fixed signs the runaway will return or be caught but evil and suffering will not reach him and the seeker's anger will be shattered.
