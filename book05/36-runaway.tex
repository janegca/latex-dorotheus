\section{The runaway}
In the matter of a runaway or a fugitive, look at the ascendant and the \Moon\, for the runaway and the \Sun\, and midheaven for the condition of the one seeking the runaway.

If the ascendant and \Moon\, are in tropical signs it indicates the runaway has travelled a distance on land or sea. If in mutable signs, someone else has run away with them. 

If they are in a crooked (short ascension) sign [\Aries,\Taurus,\Gemini,\Capricorn,\Aquarius,\Pisces] then the runaway is confused and strayed from his path or they have been caught. If in a straight (long ascension) sign [\Cancer\, thru \Sagittarius] then the runaway is not confused, will stick to his path and will arrive where he wishes to go. 

If the \Moon\, is not on the equator and is in the first 15° of a mutable sign this is the first time the person has runaway but they will make a habit of it after this. If in the last 15°, the person has runaway before.

If the \Moon\, is in the ascendant, 12th or 11th the runaway is headed East. If in the midheaven,  9th or 8th, they are headed South. If in the 7th, 6th or 5th, they are headed West; in the 4th, 3rd or 2nd, they are headed North.

If \Mars\, is stationary and with or aspecting the \Moon\, then the runaway has shed blood at the place he fled to and has been seized by force or put in chains so he may be sent back to his master or whomever is seeking them.

If \Saturn\, is with or aspecting the \Moon\, then the runaway has raised suspicions or committed a ruse and has fallen in chains because of it. If \Saturn\, is stationary and conjunct the \Moon\, the runaway may strangle themselves unless a benefic aspects, in which case the misfortune will leave them. If \Saturn\, is not stationary when the \Moon\, joins him the runaway has lost any goods he may have stolen before he ran, has wandered and will be seized and sent back to his master in misery and chains.

If the benefics are in the ascendant or aspect the ascendant or are with the \Moon\, then the runaway is truly free. If \Venus\, happens to be in this position the runaway will not be caught but if he is caught and returned he will be content.
