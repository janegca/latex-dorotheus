\section{Renting out or Leasing property}
``If \mn{1} you want to hire something or let out for rent some cultivated land or trees or vineyards or houses or anything like that\footnote{These are all 4th house items: immovable properties.}, then the: ``
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[Asc] indicates the conditions under which you will hire or rent the property
\item[7th] indicates the owner of the property
\item[10th] indicates the price of the rental or lease
\item[4th] indicates the outcome of the transaction
\end{itemize}

If \mn{2-3} malefics are in (or aspecting?) the ascendent, the person wanting to hire the property or \textsl{``take them for rent will withdraw from that and take none of them''} and if he does lease or rent them \textsl{``he will deceive him [the owner], desiring that sin and debauchery occur in it.''}

If \mn{4-5} the malefics are in or aspecting the 7th, the owner will withdraw from the transaction or, if he goes through with it, \textsl{``there will occur debauchery or prostitution and deception in it'.'}

If \mn{6} malefics are in or aspecting the 10th, \textsl{``this matter will not be proper, but there will be a pile of coins in the rent.''}

If \mn{7-8} malefics are in or aspecting the 4th, \textsl{``then, even if this matter is proper, its outcome will be bad [and] from this there will occur in it misery and what is not desired.''}. The same is also shown by the \Moon's conjunction or separation.
