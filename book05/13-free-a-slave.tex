\section{If you want to free a slave}
First see that the condition of the \Moon\, is not corrupted. If it is not, check to see if the \Moon\, is separating from a benefic and moving to a malefic; if this is the case, the slave, once freed, will fall into a worse condition than he found himself in under his current master.

If the \Moon\, is separating from malefics and moving to join a benefic, \textsl{``then it will be good for that slave as they will escape from evil and misfortune and will meet with good and joy.''}

The angles also give indications as follows:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[Asc] the master
\item[7th] the slave who is freed
\item[10th] the reason the slave was freed
\item[4th] the outcome of the matter
\end{itemize}

If the \Moon\, is in the 7th with malefics then the freed slave, even though he has escaped from slavery, will be returned to it.

Examine the other angles to see what condition they are in..
