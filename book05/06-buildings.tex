\section{One who wishes to build a building}
The \mn{1} best time to lay the foundation of a building is when the \Moon\, is \textsl{``increasing in light''} (waxing), \textsl{``increasing in computation''} (moving faster than its average motion), and \textsl{``in the middle of the zone which is the equator, ascending toward the North''} (probably means when it is close to zero declination and moving North) and preferably when \Jupiter\, or \Venus\, is with or aspecting the \Moon\, from a strong place.

If \mn{2} \Saturn\, is with or aspecting the \Moon\, from a strong place (instead of a benefic) \textsl{``there occurs...difficulty and dissension and slowness or trouble and misery''} in the work.

If \mn{3} \Mars\, is with or aspecting the \Moon\, from a strong place, \textsl{``then conflagration or injury from fire will reach that building.''}.

\section{If you wish to demolish a building}
It is best to start when the \Moon\, is \textsl{``leaving its elevation, descending towards [its] low point'} (moving from North to South declination). Also prefer a time when the benefics are strong as they \textsl{``indicate ease and success''}. If the malefics are strong they \textsl{``indicate slowness and difficulty and misery.''}
