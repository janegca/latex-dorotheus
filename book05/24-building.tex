\section{Commencing to build a ship}
The best of what is possible is when the \Sun\, is trine the benefics while the \Moon\, is waxing and fast, increasing in latitude and longitude and in the terms of a benefic.  Be sure not to start the work when the Moon and the ascendent are being harmed by \Mars\, as it \textsl{``indicates that the outcome of this work will be  bad [and] harmful because of fire or anger or oppression.''}

If the work commences when the \Moon\, is in \Aquarius, with, square or opposed by \Mars, \textsl{``then it indicates that misfortune will reach this ship from water and what is contained in it for the life of its people and their livelihood, and burning will reach it, and a severe misfortune and great  fear will happen to its people, and all of them will be cast in the sea [and there will be] a desire for the turning of men from death.''}

If the \Moon\, is not in \Aquarius, but is in a watery sign while \Mars\, and the \Sun\, are together or in square or opposition, \textsl{``it indicates that misfortune and breaking will reach this ship from the coast of the sea or from a stone or a mountain that is in the sea, and the planks of the ship will be separated on the [different] areas of the sea, and whatever of thing[s] is in it will be lost.''}

If the \Moon\, is not in a dry sign, \textsl{``then it indicates that misfortune will reach the ship on the sea from pirates and those who will cut [it] off on the sea and kill its people so that they will be drowned for this reason and what is in it will be lost.''}
