\section{Commencing to row the ship in the water}
Indications from the position of the \Moon\, in the signs at launch time if neither the benefics nor malefics are in aspect:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[\Aries] above the earth in the first 10째, the ship will have a good and safe departure
\item[\Taurus] waves will cause problems and if the malefics aspect the \Moon\, the ship will be lost to the waves
\item[\Gemini] in the first 8째, the ship will reach its destination and there will be profit from it but its departure and return journey will be slow
\item[\Cancer] the waves will not harm the ship and its people will profit from it
\item[\Leo] the men aboard the ship will be harmed and if malefics aspect the \Moon\,  misfortune  will pile on misfortune
\item[\Virgo] the departure will not be deliberate or soon
\item[\Libra] in the first 10째 there will be no good in the journey by land or sea; if in greater degrees, the journey will go well by both land and sea
\item[\Scorpio] the ship will be safe at sea but some of its people will be detained
\item[\Sagittarius] calamities and misfortune from the waves will reach the ship
\item[\Capricorn] if not in the first 9째, then things will go well but some of the ship's people will be fear being detained
\item[\Aquarius] the return journey will be slow and lingering but the outcome will be good
\item[\Pisces] misfortune and calamities will reach the ship and her people
\end{itemize}

If the \Moon\, is below the earth and in the aspect of benefics or malefics, then it is bad.

If the \Moon\, is below the earth in the same sign as a stationing \Saturn, \textsl{``then it indicates that great pains and a great [and] severe misfortune will happen to them and a hideous fear will befall them and strong waves until the water will enter the ship and the people of that ship for whom death and loss was judged in dampness or water will be lost in those waves.''}

If the \Moon\, is above the earth and a stationing \Saturn\, is \Trine, \textsl{``then it indicates that the people of the ship will throw much of what goods [they have] on this ship into the water in the hope of saving them[selves] and they will be saved from this after pain and severe misery while the \Moon\, is under the earth.''}\footnote{Dykes has ``even if the \Moon\, is under the earth''.}

If the \Moon\, is above the earth and \Saturn\, is \Trine\, but not stationing, \textsl{``then it indicates a hideous matter as if they were at the edge of a razor, but together will this fear they will be better in [their] condition, and no harm will reach them except for a little when \Saturn\, is in its station.''}\footnote{Dykes has ``when \Saturn\, is <not> in his station.''}

If \Saturn\, was in the same situation with \Mercury, \textsl{``the fear will increase the misery and hideousness; but if the benefics aspect \Saturn, then this misfortune will be easier and more comfortable, especially if the benefics aspect from the right side of \Saturn\, and [from] a strong place''}\footnote{If the benefic is in the 9th, 10th, or 11th from \Saturn\, in which case they ``overcome'' \Saturn.}

\Saturn\, will give these same indications if he is in the ascendent even if he does not aspect the \Moon.

If \Saturn\, is in the ascendent and it occupies the same sign in the natal chart of the person on the ship or if \Saturn\, is \Trine, \Square, or \Opposition\, to the sign he (\Saturn) occupies in the person's nativity, \textsl{``then it will be more hideous and worse in [his] condition.''}

If \Mars\, is found in the same conditions as were given for \Saturn\, and \Mars\, is below the earth while the \Moon\, is above, then things will be worse but the fear and misfortune will not be because of waves but will come from \textsl{``shouting and arguing and every discord, from which there will occur enmity between the people of this ship and whatever enemies there are on the sea. It also indicates difficult surgical operations and a breaking of their joints will reach them, and their blood will flow, and the like. This violence and hideousness will increase if \Mercury\, is with \Mars.''}

If \Saturn, \Mars, and \Mercury\, aspect the \Moon\, while she is above the earth, \textsl{``then they will have neither escape nor deliverance from this misfortune whose condition is hideous. It indicates [what is] like this if \Mars\, is mixed with \Mercury.''}

If \Mars\, or \Saturn\, aspects the \Sun\, while the other aspects the \Moon, then a difficult and hideous fear will reach them and it will be worse if the aspect is an \Opposition.

If the \Sun\, and the \Moon\, are not injured while the \Moon\, is above the earth and square \Jupiter\, when putting the boat in the water then it \textsl{``indicates that their actions will be favorable, easy, good and they will not be cut off from whatever of good they hope for and arrange in it, but they will obtain it, if God wishes.''} And it is even better if \Venus\, is with \Jupiter\, or aspects the \Moon\, from another sign.

The power of \Mercury\, is increased for good or ill depending on whether it is with benefics or malefics.

If \Venus\, alone aspects the \Moon\, while the \Moon\, is above the earth, \textsl{``it indicates that these waves and the misfortune will not reach them in their faces, and they will be blessed with profit and good in it, but it is not like the aspect of \Jupiter\, and \Venus\, together because \Venus\, alone is weak.''}

\textsl{``If the \Moon\, and \Venus\, are together in the same sign under the earth and \Venus\, is under the [Sun's] rays, then it indicates that these waves will not befall them in their face[s], and this ship will reach its destination which they desire without misfortune.''}

\textsl{``If \Jupiter\, and \Venus\, together aspect the \Sun\, and the \Moon\, while the \Moon\, is with \Mercury, then it indicates that the commencement at that hour of rowing the ship in the water or in the sea is like the best of what is [possible] of commencements.''}

If the malefics are in the ascendent and the \Moon\, is with the benefics in the descendent or if the \Moon\, is with the benefics in the ascendent and the malefics are opposite, in the descendent, \textsl{``then misfortune will reach this ship from the sea, but its people will escape from that fear, if God wishes and judges it.''}

\textsl{``Even if the \Moon\, is without the aspect of the benefics in a cardine and it is in one of the signs which we named in the introduction to this''} [section], \textsl{``[saying] that [it will be good] if the \Moon\, is in them, it will be good, if God wishes.''}

If the \Moon\, and ascendent are not with malefics or benefics and no benefics or malefics aspect either one, \textsl{``then let this commencement of rowing the boat in the water and the sea be when the ascendent and the \Moon\, are in one of the signs which I reported and approved for commencing this matter.''}

The commencement \textsl{``is when the ship is released and pushed in the water, and the commencement of the matter for one who rides on it is first when the man places his foot in it. If the ship and its people arrive a the land that you aimed for, then it is necessary to consider concerning the commencement of the arrival of the ship and its people if they are one.''}

If someone is starting a journey by land, and the \Moon\, is in the 7th, not in a dry sign, but the malefics are in or aspecting dry signs, or, if starting a journey by sea and the \Moon\, is not in a watery sign or in a sign whose nature is wet, while the malefics are in or aspecting it, the journey (by land or sea) \textsl{``will not be good, but discomfort and misery will reach him.''}

\textsl{``If the \Moon\, is injured while the benefics are in the dry, earthy signs or aspect these signs, then it indicates that misfortune will barely not reach them in this journey of theirs, and if it does reach them, then it will be less that what I mentioned.''}

\textsl{``If the masters of this journey are some for whom death is not judged and whose years are not determined, then they will depart for their houses; if misfortune does reach them, then it will be less than what I mentioned.''}

\textsl{``The malefics among the stars are the worst of what is [possible] in damages, \Mars\, if the traveller is a traveller of the land, and \Saturn\, [for a traveller] on sea and water; and it is the worst of what is [possible in damages if \Jupiter\, and \Venus\, do not aspect these two.''}

\textsl{``The worst of what is [possible] is the \Moon\, in a term or figure [decan] of the ``} [malefics\footnote{The text has `benefics' but Dkyes has `infortunes' or malefics, which makes more sense.}] \textsl{``with a malefic aspecting the \Moon\, from opposition or quartile and \Jupiter\, and \Venus\, not aspecting the \Moon\, either together or one of the two.''}
