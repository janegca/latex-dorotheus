\section{Query about the sick}

If the question is about a sick person and, at the time, the \Moon\, is flowing (separating) from the benefics, \textsl{``then it indicates [his] recovery from this illness.''}

But if the \Moon\, is flowing from \Mars\,, \textsl{``then it indicates that the illness is from a fever which will exhaust him, or [that] one of his limbs will be cut from his body with an iron [knife], or [that] in cutting or phlebotomy he will be bled from his veins with an iron [knife].''} and if the \Moon\, is waxing, \textsl{``then it will be more hideous and worse for his illness.''}

If the \Moon\, is flowing from \Saturn, \textsl{``then it indicates a fever that shakes [him], and a hidden malaise in [his] diet, or some of this will reach him in [his] belly or in [his] body, or his spleen will swell, and sometimes it will bring down a miserable disease on him, and a wound and difficult sore will reach him so that his limbs will be wounded or will be dislocated, and sometimes [his] black bile will be stirred up in him until his intestines are cramped and burn, and it is an indicator that every illness which reaches him will stay in him a long time.''}
