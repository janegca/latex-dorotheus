\section{Asking for a ruler or man to grant a request or gift}
Ask for the granting of a request or gift when the \Moon\, is moving faster than its average motion, is waxing, not USB and is in, square, or trine the Ascendent, or, when the ruler of the Ascendent is direct and in the same sign as the \Moon\, and the two are conjunct.

It will be better if the \Moon\, is in \Cancer\, or aspecting \Cancer\, while \Mercury\, is with \Jupiter\, as if you ask while the \Moon\, is with or aspecting \Saturn\, the request or gift will not be granted.

If you make the request while \Mercury\, is with \Venus\, \textsl{``and his desire is in front of women and is something pleasing him and he is amused by it, then he will grant [it] in this.''}

If the request and desire are in front of kings and nobles of men and leaders, then you will be disappointed if you ask at an hour when \Jupiter\, is retrograde or \Saturn\, aspects \Jupiter.

If the request is made in front of scientists and people of culture and masters of calculation, then pick an hour when \Mercury\, is strong.

If the request is made in front of an older man or a man with no children or a criminal or a slave, then pick an hour when \Saturn\, is strong.
