\section{Judgment according to the twin signs}
If the Ascendent is in a twin (probably \Gemini, \Virgo, \Sagittarius, \Pisces) sign, \textsl{``then it indicates that that action which he commences at that hour will not be finished until an action other than this occurs in it, and it [the second action] will be finished before the first action is finished; it happens thus in every action in which the ascendent is a twin sign.''}

\textbf{The diurnal and nocturnal signs}

The diurnal signs are those in the Fire (\Aries, \Leo, \Sagittarius) and Air (\Gemini, \Libra, \Aquarius) signs.

The nocturnal signs are those in the Earth (\Taurus, \Virgo, \Capricorn) and Water (\Cancer, \Scorpio, \Pisces) signs.

If someone wants to begin an action during the day, then it is best to have the Ascendent and \Moon\, in a diurnal sign. If they want to start something during the night, it is best to have them in a nocturnal sign, especially if one is going to start a journey or board a ship as it will make the trip \textsl{``easy, fortunate, convenient, if God---be He exalted!---wishes.''}
