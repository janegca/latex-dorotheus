\section{Bondage and chains}
If a man is put into bondage or chains \textsl{``because of the anger of a king or a man against his slaves''}, look to the sign the Moon was in at the moment he was bound:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[\Aries] indicates the chains will soon be loosened

\item[\Taurus] indicates he is chained because of the property he sought to have, and that property was taken from him and that the chains will stay on him for a long time \textsl{``but he will be saved from this pain in his body after [his] misfortune''}

\item[\Gemini] if the chains are not removed within three days they will stay on him for  long time
] 
\item[\Cancer] the chains will stay on him for a long time

\item[\Leo] \textsl{``these chains are because of a man who has importance and power, [and] he will not escape from the chains until they been a long time on him}

\item[\Virgo] indicates a mixture of good and bad with the good being more abundant and \textsl{``there will be ease in him''}

\item[\Libra] the chained person will escape from the chains

\item[\Scorpio] the chains will be on for a long time and cause him to be chronically ill but at the end \textsl{``there will be release from them''}

\item[\Sagittarius] the chains will stay on for a long time

\item[\Capricorn] there will be no escape from the chains

\item[\Aquarius] the chains will cling to him all his life, he will be shackled and not able to escape them except through death

\item[\Pisces] same as \Aquarius

\end{itemize}

If the \Moon\, is with or aspected by the malefics the situation will be altered.

If \Jupiter\, or \Venus\, is with the \Moon\, or in the Ascendant or aspects both the \Moon\, and the Ascendant, then the person will be quickly released from his chains.

If \Mercury\, and \Jupiter\, are with or aspecting the \Moon\,  \textsl{``then it indicates that [his] power in escaping from these chains will increase and it will hasten it, if God--be He exalted!--wishes.''}

If \Mars\, is with the \Moon\, or aspects it, then \textsl{``it indicates that beating and difficulties and burning or bite[s] or sting[s] will reach him in these chains, or a surgical operation with a piece of iron will happen to him from this suffering and pain.''}

If \Saturn\, is with or aspecting the \Moon\ then his misery will last a long time and he'll stay shackled and not be free except after pain and misery.

If \Mercury, \Saturn, \Mars, and the \Moon\, are all together or the \Moon\, is in the aspect of all three, \textsl{``then it indicates he will die in these chains''}

The Ascendant has indications similar to those of the \Moon\, for anyone in chains if the \Moon\, is decreasing and it will be worse for them if the \Moon\, is increasing. The \Moon's weakening is when she is in the same degree as the \Sun\, or in its opposition as \textsl{``then this is an indicator that these chains will be misery and trouble, [but] then he will be freed from them.''}

If the \Moon\, joins with \Mercury\, while \Mercury\, is western, it indicates release from chains. 

If the \Moon\, is \textsl{``departing from the middle of the equator, being taken towards the qibla [the South] with \Mercury\, and \Venus, then it indicates release from this soon.''}

If \Saturn\, and \Jupiter\, aspect the \Moon\, from trine, \textsl{``then it indicates that the owner of these chains will not escape until he has been a long time in them, but he will be freed with a good reputation and profit.''}

The region from the midheaven to the angle of the fathers (the fourth) is called the \textsl{``region of descent, which is concealed; they call the region from the cardine of the fathers [the fourth] to midheaven the region of ascent, which is the region of the ascendent.''} If the \Moon\, is in the region of descent, which is concealed, and the \Mars\, is aspecting the \Moon\, \textsl{``then it indicates that the owner of the chains will be set free of it quickly in death from it or [in] life.''}

If the \Moon\, is in the region of ascent and \Mars\, is trine while \Jupiter\, is square, \textsl{``then the owner of these chains will escape from his chains and his bonds.''}

If \Saturn\, is with the \Moon\, while \Jupiter\, aspects it from the 10th or by square then it means release from the chains.

If \Mars\, aspects the \Moon\, from square and \Saturn\, from trine, \textsl{``then these chains will stay a long time on  him and pain and misery will happen to him in [his] escape from them.''}

If \Mars\, aspects the \Moon\, from trine and \Saturn\, from square, \textsl{``then it indicates that misery and effort will reach the owner of these chains, then he will break these chains and bonds and will escape from them in flight.''}

\textsl{``It is necessary to look concerning the house of the fathers [the fourth] more than the [other] cardines because in it is the clarification of every outcome.''}
