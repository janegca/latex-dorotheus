\section{Will the native's property increase or decrease?}
If you want to know when the property of the native will increase or decrease, then look at the second sign from the ascendant which is the house of property. If the distributor of the time is in this sign while the malefics are in it or aspecting it by square or opposition then the native's property will be diminished.

If the benefics are there or aspecting it while the distributor is in the term of one of the benefics, \textsl{``then it indicates that the native's property and his happiness will increase''}.

Also examine the \Moon, if it is transiting or otherwise moving through a sign occupied by the malefics in the nativity or through their square or opposition without the aspect of the benefics \textsl{``then it indicates that at that hour pain and grief and worry and misery will reach that native.''}

If the \Moon\, arrives in the sign he occupied in the nativity and the benefics are in the same sign or aspect the \Moon\, by trine\footnote{The text actually says ``the benefics do not aspect the Moon from trine'' but that doesn't make any sense given what follows.} while the malefics are not aspecting them \textsl{``then joy and benefit and good will reach this native because of clothes or other than this because of [something] like what had not befallen this native before this, so that his happiness and his joy will be more intense than this.''}
