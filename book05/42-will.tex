\section{The Will}

If a man wants to make his will, let him start when the \Moon\ is ascendent or in a tropical sign  as it indicates the will and the legacy will be changed. Let him make his will when the \Moon\ is increasing latitude, decreasing in computation [slowing]  and increasing in light [waxing] and it is ascending in the North, conjoining with a planet in its station and not under the \Sun's rays. If it is under \Sun's rays but emerging and not in the same sign as the \Sun, then it does not indicate immediate death.

Avoid making your will in the hour in which \Mars\ is with the \Moon\ or in the ascendant as the hour indicates the will will not be changed, and the patient will die from his illness, and the will will not be executed after his death, but someone after him will refute him in his will and write in the will or steal the will. You should not make any will when \Mars\ is with the \Moon\ or in the ascendant or in the quartile of the ascendant or in its opposition or aspects the \Moon\ or the ascendant.

If \Mars\ is not in these positions but \Saturn\ is with the \Moon\ or with the ascendant, then it indicates that there will be a delay in the time at which he makes the will, and the will will be removed afterwards and will not be executed in his lifetime or after his death.

If \Saturn\ is not in this position but \Venus\ or \Jupiter\ is with the \Moon\ or in the ascendant, then,after some of the life of the owner of the will has passed, he will change the will.
