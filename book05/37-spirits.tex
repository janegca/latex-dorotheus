\section{The treatment of Spirits}
If you want to expel a spirit from a house or a person by using drugs, incantations, religious remedies, entreaty,  appeal, or some other strategy then begin your action when the ascendant and the \Moon\, are in \Aries, \Taurus, or \Gemini\, and avoid acting when they ae in \Cancer\, or \Leo.

It's good when the pair are in \Virgo, \Libra, \Sagittarius, \Capricorn\, or \Pisces\, and even better if \Jupiter\, and \Venus\, are in the ascendant with the \Moon.

There will be no good in the action if the pair are in \Scorpio\, or \Aquarius.
