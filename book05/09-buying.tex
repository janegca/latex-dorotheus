\section{Buying and Selling}
If \mn{1} you want to buy or sell something, look at the \Moon\, (which represents the commodity being bought or sold); the planet she is separating from represents the seller, the planet she is applying to represents the buyer and the price.

Malefics \mn{3-4} with or aspecting any of the three (\Moon, planet applied to, planet separated from) indicate \textsl{``misfortune or misery''} for the injured significator. If the benefics are with one of the three, \textsl{``then joy and happiness, and success''} is indicated for the significator \textsl{``if God wishes.''}

The \mn{6-7} angles also give indications:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item{Asc} represents the buyer
\item{7th} represents the seller
\item{4th} represents the commodity being bought or sold
\item{10th} represents the price
\end{itemize}

The benefics in or aspecting an angle represent gain for whatever the angle represents, malefics in or aspecting represent loss.
