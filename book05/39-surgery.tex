\section{On being bled or going under the knife}
Avoid being bled or going under the knife when the ascendant or the \Moon\, is in \Taurus, \Virgo, \Capricorn, or \Pisces. It should also be avoided when the \Moon\, is new and not separated from the \Sun\, by at least 13Â° or when it is separating from an opposition of the \Sun\, and waning.

As well, ensure that \Mars\, is not with or aspecting the \Moon\, or the ascendant.

If someone does undergo surgery when \Mars\, or \Saturn\, is with or aspecting the \Moon\, or ascendant, then the person \textsl{``is not about to escape from it or he will soon become accustomed to this cutting.'} It is best for this if the \Moon\, is waning and \textsl{``the malefics are not in the succedent of the \Moon, that is when they are behind the \Moon''}\footnote{As he's used the word `succedent' here I think he is implying primary motion i.e. you don't want the malefics rising after the \Moon. This appears to contradict the earlier admonition to any action when the \Moon\, is waning; possibly, a waxing \Moon\, is better for blood-letting and a waning \Moon\, is better for surgery when you don't want a lot of blood.}

\textsl{``Let the \Moon\, and the ascendent be with \Venus\, or [let] \Jupiter\, or \Venus\, aspect the ascendent while the \Moon\, is among them free from the malefics.''}

Avoid any treatment, by knife or scalpel, to the part of the body ruled by the sign the \Moon\, or ascendant occupies at the time.

If the \Moon\, or the ascendant are in tropical or mutable signs there will be no good in the action unless the benefics are with or aspecting the \Moon.
