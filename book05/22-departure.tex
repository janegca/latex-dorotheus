\section{Departure from a journey}
If you want to know when the traveller will return to his land, home and house and whether the return will be deliberate or difficult and slow, and how long it will take, \textsl{``then look at the opposition to the \Sun\, and its quartile.''}

If \Jupiter\, or \Venus\, are in \Square\ or \Opposition\, to the \Sun\, \textsl{``then he will soon return from this journey of his safely.''}

If \Saturn\, or \Mars\, are in \Square\, or \Opposition\, to the \Sun\, \textsl{``then his departure will be delayed and will be slow''} and he won't return until:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the malefics move out of aspect with the \Moon\, and the \Moon\, comes to her own \Square\, or \Opposition, or,
\item the \Sun\, returns to where it was at the start of the journey or the opposition of that place and he is free from injury
\end{itemize}

If he starts the return journey when the \Moon\, is \Square\, or in \Opposition\, to or with the malefics without being in the aspect of a benefic, then his departure will be in difficulty and pain and misery or he will be unable to leave for home because of illness.

If the malefics are not \Square\, or in \Opposition\, to the \Moon\, but the \Moon\, is with one of the malefics while the benefics are in aspect to it and the \Sun\, \textsl{``then it indicates that misfortune and a hideous, difficult matter and pain will happen to him because of this conjunction, but despite this if the benefics aspect the \Sun\, and the \Moon, the he will return to his land and his home.''}

If a malefic is the sign on the right of the \Moon\, and the other malefic is in the sign to the left of the \Moon\, then she is ``squeezed'' between the malefics and \textsl{``it indicates that a difficult, hideous pain will reach him in his journey, and it will be worse for these calamities if \Jupiter\, is not aspecting the \Moon; but if it is aspecting it, then it will diminish this misfortune and [these] calamities.''}
