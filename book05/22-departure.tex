\section{Departure from a journey}
If you want to know when the traveller will return to his land, home and house and whether the return will be deliberate or difficult and slow, and how long it will take, \textsl{``then look at the opposition to the \Sun\, and its quartile.''}

If \Jupiter\, or \Venus\, are in \Square\ or \Opposition\, to the \Sun\, \textsl{``then he will soon return from this journey of his safely.''}

If \Saturn\, or \Mars\, are in \Square\, or \Opposition\, to the \Sun\, \textsl{``then his departure will be delayed and will be slow''} and he won't return until:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the malefics move out of aspect with the \Moon\, and the \Moon\, comes to her own \Square\, or \Opposition, or,
\item the \Sun\, returns to where it was at the start of the journey or the opposition of that place and he is free from injury
\end{itemize}

If he starts the return journey when the \Moon\, is \Square\, or in \Opposition\, to or with the malefics without being in the aspect of a benefic, then his departure will be in difficulty and pain and misery or he will be unable to leave for home because of illness.

If the malefics are not \Square\, or in \Opposition\, to the \Moon\, but the \Moon\, is with one of the malefics while the benefics are in aspect to it and the \Sun\, \textsl{``then it indicates that misfortune and a hideous, difficult matter and pain will happen to him because of this conjunction, but despite this if the benefics aspect the \Sun\, and the \Moon, the he will return to his land and his home.''}

If a malefic is the sign on the right of the \Moon\, and the other malefic is in the sign to the left of the \Moon\, then she is ``squeezed'' between the malefics and \textsl{``it indicates that a difficult, hideous pain will reach him in his journey, and it will be worse for these calamities if \Jupiter\, is not aspecting the \Moon; but if it is aspecting it, then it will diminish this misfortune and [these] calamities.''}

\textsl{If you want to know the condition of his departure from this journey of his, whether it will be soon [and] deliberate or slow [and] remote, then it is necessary to consider concerning this if he has arrived at the land which he desires.''}

Look at the sign the lord of the ascendant is in and the sign of the house of property, the second. If the lord of the second sign is retrograde, \textsl{``then it indicates that his departure from this journey of his will be soon [and] quick, [but] bad [and] he will profit in nothing from this journey and will satisfy none of his needs but will be rid of them.''}

If the lord of the second is stationing, \textsl{``then it indicates his departure in slowness and a lengthy lingering.''}

If the lord of the second stations and then turns direct, \textsl{``then his departure will be middling, but with the satisfaction of [his] need and leisure from the business on which he was travelling.''}

If the lord of the second is in the ascendant or the tenth, \textsl{``then it indicates that he will see in this journey of his health and security from misfortunes.''}

If the lord of the second is in the fourth, \textsl{``then it indicates that there will be fear of death for him in this journey of his.''}

If the \Moon\, is with \Saturn\, when he reaches where he was going, \textsl{``then it will be a sign indicating slowness and injury in property, and he will stay behind in that absence of his because of illness and he will persist in it.''}

If the \Moon\, is with \Mercury\, and \Mars\, opposes both of them, \textsl{``then it indicates that there will reach him in this journey of his beating and breaking and injury and the rest of misfortunes.''}

If \Mercury\, and \Saturn\, are in opposition to the \Moon, \textsl{``then it indicates that there will happen to him in this journey of his slowness and estrangement, and he will conceal [his] perfidy and stealing and evil, but he will be suspected and seized on account of this and imprisoned, and his wealth will be destroyed.''}

If \Mars\, is in \Sagittarius\, with the \Moon\, or if it aspects the \Moon\, from \Sagittarius, \textsl{``then it indicates that there will happen to him on this journey of his and [during] his absence beating and breaking and injury.''}

If the \Moon\, is injured, look at the sign she is in as well as the sign of the planet injuring her; if they are both in signs having the nature of beasts, the injury will come from beasts; if they are in human signs, the injury will be caused by men.

If the journey is begun when \Mercury\, is with the \Moon\, and \Jupiter\, aspects them from trine or quartile, \textsl{``then it indicates that his business on this journey will be easy, favorable, [and] beneficial, [and] the departure will be quick in ease and well-being.''}
