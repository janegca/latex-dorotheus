\section{Illness as Qitrinus the Sadwali says}
To know the condition of a patient at the beginning of his illness and for how long it will endure, look at the ascendant and its ruler, the \Moon\, and its ruler, any planet the \Moon\, conjuncts, and the \Moon's dodecatemorion.

If, at the time the patient became ill, benefics were ruling the \Moon\, and the ascendant, or aspecting them and the \Moon's dodecatemorion, or the \Moon\, was with a benefic, then a quick recovery is indicated but if the malefics hold these relationships with the \Moon\, and ascendant, the patient will be ill for a long time.

If the lord of the illness is \Mars, the illness is the result of heat; if \Saturn, the illness is from consumption, coldness and swelling and will be with him for a long time.

If the \Moon\, is afflicted by the malefics but not the ascendant, the illness will harm his body.

If the ascendant is harmed by the malefics but not the \Moon\, then the injury is to his soul and will overwhelm his understanding and blind him or something similar disaster that will ruin his soul.

If the malefics aspect the ascendant without the aspect of the benefics then the patient will die because of the illness, and grievance and pain will in the limb indicated by the sign occupied\footnote{The text says `governed' but that would limit the \Moon\, to \Cancer.} by the \Moon\, or ascendant and if malefics are in this sign or its opposition the pain will be harsher.
