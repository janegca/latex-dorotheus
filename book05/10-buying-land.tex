\section{The buying of land}
The angles give indications as follows:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[4th] the condition of the land itself
\item[10th] the condition of any trees on the land
\item[7th]  the condition of any grass, herbs, or plants on the land
\item[Asc] the lands state of cultivation
\end{itemize}

If the 4th is in a watery sign \textsl{``then it indicates the land is near a river or on a sea or in a place abounding in water; if it is in a twin sign, then it indicates that this land is not of one direction...''}\footnote{Dykes indicates it might consist of ``mountains and plains.'' Basically, it will be of two differing terrains.}.  Examine the malefics and benefics with respect to the angles and judge accordingly.
