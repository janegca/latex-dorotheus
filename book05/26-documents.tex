\section{The arrival of a book, message, or letter}
If a book, message, or letter arrives and, in the base chart, 
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item \Mercury\, is in the aspect of benefics, or
\item \Mercury\, is a sign where there are no malefics, or
\item \Mercury\, is with the \Sun\, and \Moon\, and benefics aspect
\end{itemize}
then \textsl{``there is good in the book or letter.''}

\textsl{``Concerning the report which arrives in the book or letter, look at the \Sun\, and the \Moon\, in their motion as, if they are both free from the malefics while the \Moon\, is with \Mercury\, in one of those signs of which I wrote that [it is good if] they are free from malefics and the benefics are in them or aspect them, then there are happiness and joy in the book or message or letter which reaches the master of that nativity at that hour.''}

\textsl{``If, at that hour when the book or message or letter arrives, the \Moon\, is in one of those signs and a malefic is with it while none of the benefics is with it or aspects it, then in the book or message or letter which arrives at that hour [there will be] discord and misfortune and injury.''}

\textsl{``If \Mercury\, is in some one of the places of the benefics from among those signs and is eastern while the benefics and the malefics aspect it together, then the message is good.''} 

\textsl{``There were some of the scientists who considered concerning this matter in another way. They said: they look a \Jupiter\, and \Venus\, in their transit. If they reach the sign in which the two luminaries were at the nativity of this man or are in quartile of that sign in which the two luminaries were, or [if] the sign in which \Jupiter\, and \Venus\, are in their transits, this is free from the malefics while \Mercury\, is free from the malefics and aspects of \Jupiter\, or \Venus, then in this book or message or letter which reaches the master of this nativity at that hour there will be joy and happiness and profit.''}

\textsl{``If in this transit \Saturn\, or \Mars\, or both of them are in the sign in which the two luminaries were in the nativity or are in quartile of that sign while \Mercury\, is with them or aspects them, then the book or message or letter which at that hour reaches the master of this nativity will be bad, and if he is a traveller at that hour, injury will befall him.''}
