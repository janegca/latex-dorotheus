\section{Debt and payment for it}
The Ascendent signifies the claimant (the person to whom the debt is due) and the condition of the borrower is shown by the 7th, the \Moon\, and \Mercury.

If the \Moon\, is with or aspected by benefics while a malefic injures it, the debtor will pay his debt but will need to re-borrow it. If the \Moon\, is USB, judge the condition from the \Sun\, using the same rules and see if he is free of the malefics.

If \Mercury\, is with \Saturn\, \textsl{``there will be confusion and deception and trickery in the payment of the debt.''}

If \Mercury\, is with or in the aspect of \Mars, the debtor will need to borrow again and the two will fight and shout and quarrel over it.

If the \Moon\, or the Asc is in the burnt place\footnote{The burnt path is the portion of the zodiac between 19 \Libra\, and 3 \Scorpio\, or 15 \Libra\, and 15 \Scorpio\, depending on who you read.}, or, if the \Moon\, is in the first degrees of \Leo\, or \Gemini\, or \Capricorn, \textsl{``then it will not be good if you decide anything according to this.''} i.e. don't lend, borrow, or attempt to make a judgment from the chart.

If you want to borrow, it is best to do so when the \Moon\, is waning in \Leo\, or \Pisces\, or \Aquarius\, or \Scorpio\, or \Sagittarius\, and \Jupiter, \Venus, and \Mercury\, are aspecting either the \Moon\, or the Ascendant; and its more powerful if they aspect both.
