\section{The commencement of all things}
At the beginning of any action, look to the lord of the action. Sometimes you commence a matter when the benefics aspect the \Moon\, and the ascendent but the lord of the action is under the \Sun's rays or injured or does not aspect the ascendent and is in a bad place; in that case, the action will be bad and no good in it.

If you want to buy land or give the power of attorney to someone, then look at the power of \Saturn\, and \Jupiter.

Look to \Mercury\, if it is a taking away or a gift or a quarrel or a practice or a partnership or an insult or a love or trade or seeking culture or something similar.

Look to \Venus\, if it is a wedding or a marriage or something pleasant of the acts of \Venus.

If its a fight or arms or something similar then look to \Mars.

Look to \Jupiter\, if its a matter of kings, requests of kings, or government.

If it is something that does not involve evil, or ruse, or secrecy then look to the \Sun\, and \Jupiter.

Every time \Jupiter\, aspects a planet it turns it towards good; \Venus\, does the same but not in momentous affairs unless it is with \Jupiter\, or \Jupiter\, also aspects.

The power of \Venus\, is in the love that is between two people or food or perfume or things similar to these.

In every time and in every situation \Jupiter\, is good because it increases the propriety and the good or diminishes and destroys the evil and misfortune.
