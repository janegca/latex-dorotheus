\section{On the recovery of goods stolen, lost, or mislaid}
If asked about whether stolen, lost, or mislaid goods will be recovered look at the two lights and if, at the time of asking, each light is in trine to its dispositor, the goods will be recovered quickly and without pain.

If the \Sun\, and \Moon\, are square, the lost goods will be found with trouble and after a long time; the thieves will have moved the goods from their original hiding place to another.

If the \Sun\, and \Moon\, are opposed, the goods will be found, with trouble, after a time.

If the \Moon\, is found in a house along with the planet owning the house, then the goods will be found; especially if the \Sun\, also aspects the place.

If the dodecatemorion (12th part) of the \Moon\, is in one of the ascendant, midheaven, the same sign as the \Sun, or the sign holding the lord of the \Moon, or a sign with an eastern\footnote{Probably means a planet that is eastern with respect to the \Sun.} planet, then the goods will be found.

If the \Sun\, is with, or aspects, the Lot of Fortune, it indicates the goods will soon be recovered.

If the \Moon\, is with or aspects Fortune without it being with or aspected by the \Sun\, it indicates the goods will be recovered but with slowness and trouble.

The \Moon\, or both lights are in the ascendant it indicates a quick recovery of what was lost or stolen.

If the two lights are in the sign opposite the ascending sign will only recover the goods with slowness and trouble or a quarrel and insult and fighting.

If the \Sun\, is alone in the ascendant and the ascendant is not in \Aquarius, \Gemini, or \Libra\, (all signs which oppose the signs where the \Sun\, is in his triplicity) he will recover what was lost or stolen. \textsl{If [the \Sun] is in one of those three signs it will be bad and it will not be suitable for him to possess it.}

If the person's nativity is known and, at the time the goods were lost or stolen, the \Sun\, was in the ascendant while the \Moon\, was in a sign that holds a benefic in the nativity, the indication is that the person will recover what was lost.

\subsection{Unlikely to be found}

If the \Moon\, is in the end degrees of the sign opposite the ascendant sign or the second sign from it, the indication is the goods will not be found, but, if the \Sun\, is trine the \Moon, then the goods will likely be found as the \Sun\, illuminates everything dark and overcomes it, if God wishes.

If the \Moon\, is in the ``burned way'' then it indicates the person will either not recover the goods or they will recover them only after trouble and delay.

If both lights are under the Earth it indicates the goods will disappear and not be recovered.

If neither light is with or aspecting Fortune it indicates the owner might as well not bother looking for the goods as it would bring only toil and not accomplish anything.

If the \Moon\, is under the \Sun's rays and waxing it indicates the person will not perfectly recover their goods \textsl{``because this is an unavoidable judgment''}.

\subsection{Using the angles for various significators}
Some ancients used the ascendant (1st) as the significator of the stolen or lost goods, the midheaven (10th) for the good's owner; the sign opposite the ascendant (7th) for the thief, and IC (4th) for the thieves den and hiding place.

If benefics are in the ascendant the goods will be returned to the owner.

If a planet in the midheaven is in his own dignities then the owner of the goods is sincere and will seek his good in the proper manner; if the planet is not in its own dignities it has no power in the midheaven and the seeker is not truthful.

If the sign on the IC is mutable the stolen property belongs to two men; if in a tropical sign, it belongs to one man; if in a feminine sign the goods belong to women.

If the sign on the IC is moist then what was stolen or lost is near a sea or spring or stream or a valley or a river or a canal or a place where there is water. If in a quadruped sign the stolen goods are in \textsl{``the dung of sheep or the shelter of animals or in the place where animals are tied up or the habitations of animals.''}.
	
If the IC is in a human sign and \Jupiter\, and \Venus\, aspect it, then the goods are in a good and clean place. If, instead, \Mars\, aspects, they are in a place where fire is found, or a blacksmith's forge or something similar. If \Saturn\, aspects, the thieves handed the goods over to slaves who placed them in a dark house or a filthy place open to the wind or a lofty, moist, dark, and dirty place.

If \Jupiter\, occupies the IC while \Saturn\, aspects the place then the goods were handed over to a person of noble lineage. If \Mars, rather than \Jupiter, is in the IC then the person receiving the stolen goods will have the loathsome character of a slave or one free for the day. 

If, instead, \Venus\, is in the first 20 degrees of the IC then the thieves will have stolen the goods from propertied women of noble lineage. If it is in the last 10 degrees of the sign of the IC then slave girls or those who do the work of slave girls will take the stolen items from the thieves.

If, instead, \Mercury\, is in the first 10 degrees of the sign on the IC, then a man of noble lineage and wisdom and of good reputation will take what was stolen from the thieves. If in the middle 10 degrees, a poor man will take the goods from the thieves and will be \textsl{``master of wealth and good fortune for the day''}. If in the last 10 degrees, the man who takes the goods from the thieves is a slave or a man who does the work of slaves.

\subsection{Indications from the Lights}
If the \Sun\, aspects Fortune then the owner will soon recover his goods. If, instead, the \Moon\, aspects Fortune without the aspect of the \Sun, the goods will be recovered after a delay. If neither light aspects Fortune or the Ascendant the goods will only be recovered after trouble and pain.

If the \Moon\, is square, trine, or in the sign opposite the ascendant then the lost or stolen goods will be recovered. 

If the \Sun\,  was trine, square, or in opposition to the \Moon\, while he was in the ascendant or midheaven or with Fortune or aspecting the angles then the goods will be properly recovered. 

If the \Moon\, is the last degrees of a sign (the 3rd decan), then the stolen goods will be moved from place to place.
