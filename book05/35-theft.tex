\section{On the recovery of goods stolen, lost, or mislaid}
If asked about whether stolen, lost, or mislaid goods will be recovered look at the two lights and if, at the time of asking, each light is in trine to its dispositor, the goods will be recovered quickly and without pain.

If the \Sun\, and \Moon\, are square, the lost goods will be found with trouble and after a long time; the thieves will have moved the goods from their original hiding place to another.

If the \Sun\, and \Moon\, are opposed, the goods will be found, with trouble, after a time.

If the \Moon\, is found in a house along with the planet owning the house, then the goods will be found; especially if the \Sun\, also aspects the place.

If the dodecatemorion (12th part) of the \Moon\, is in one of the ascendant, midheaven, the same sign as the \Sun, or the sign holding the lord of the \Moon, or a sign with an eastern\footnote{Probably means a planet that is eastern with respect to the \Sun.} planet, then the goods will be found.

If the \Sun\, is with, or aspects, the Lot of Fortune, it indicates the goods will soon be recovered.

If the \Moon\, is with or aspects Fortune without it being with or aspected by the \Sun\, it indicates the goods will be recovered but with slowness and trouble.

The \Moon\, or both lights are in the ascendant it indicates a quick recovery of what was lost or stolen.

If the two lights are in the sign opposite the ascending sign will only recover the goods with slowness and trouble or a quarrel and insult and fighting.

If the \Sun\, is alone in the ascendant and the ascendant is not in \Aquarius, \Gemini, or \Libra\, (all signs which oppose the signs where the \Sun\, is in his triplicity) he will recover what was lost or stolen. \textsl{If [the \Sun] is in one of those three signs it will be bad and it will not be suitable for him to possess it.}

If the person's nativity is known and, at the time the goods were lost or stolen, the \Sun\, was in the ascendant while the \Moon\, was in a sign that holds a benefic in the nativity, the indication is that the person will recover what was lost.

\subsection{Unlikely to be found}

If the \Moon\, is in the end degrees of the sign opposite the ascendant sign or the second sign from it, the indication is the goods will not be found, but, if the \Sun\, is trine the \Moon, then the goods will likely be found as the \Sun\, illuminates everything dark and overcomes it, if God wishes.

If the \Moon\, is in the ``burned way'' then it indicates the person will either not recover the goods or they will recover them only after trouble and delay.

If both lights are under the Earth it indicates the goods will disappear and not be recovered.

If neither light is with or aspecting Fortune it indicates the owner might as well not bother looking for the goods as it would bring only toil and not accomplish anything.

If the \Moon\, is under the \Sun's rays and waxing it indicates the person will not perfectly recover their goods \textsl{``because this is an unavoidable judgment''}.
