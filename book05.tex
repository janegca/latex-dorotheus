\section{Introduction}
\begin{quote}
\mn{1.1-2}\textsl{This is the book of Dorotheus, King of Egypt. There are five books; he wrote four of them on nativities in which he mentioned every good and evil, and misery or happiness that men may attain from the beginning of their situation till its end, and he wrote one of them about the matter of commencements, and it is this book which is called the fifth book, in which he mentioned the condition of every action which is begun, whether its limit is determined or it is not determined where the beginning of this action or its middle or its end will end up and what of good or evil will happen in it.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
\mn{1.3}\textsl{He says in his book that he is following the tracks of the learned men who practised from among the learned of Babylon and Egypt since they were the first who looked concerning the science of the stars and their calculation and the revolution of the sphere and the motions of the seven stars and the rising-times of the twelve signs so that he might extract this from their books, then give this to himself as an example in his following [them].}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
\mn{1.4}\textsl{He says that, wherever he looked concerning what they dealt with and arranged of the science of the stars, he followed the best of their science and acquired it and explained it and collected it and extracted it from their books as he made it an example for himself in his following their tracks, and he made it this book like a bee when it follows the most delicious of fruits, and the best of it is made into honey; then he began to write for this book a comprehensive introduction in which he mentions the power of the seven and the twelve, and their soundness and their corruption.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
\mn{1.5}\textsl{He said: look concerning the commencing of each matter you desire at the straight in rising from among the signs and the crooked, and the tropical and the twin from among them, and at the position of the star which is in the ascendent in the commencement of each action, [to see whether] its end will be good or bad.}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
\mn{1.6-8}\textsl{It is necessary if you commence [something] to know what is the nature of the signs straight in rising and crooked. I shall make clear to you [those] of them that are straight and crooked. The straight among them are \Cancer, \Leo, \Virgo, \Libra, \Scorpio, and \Sagittarius\, because each one of these six rises in two hours and a part of an hour of the equinotical hours, which are the hours [of the nychthemeron\footnote{A full 24 hour period lasting a night (Greek \textsl{nyx}) and day (Greek \textsl{hÄ“mera}) }]} in which the night and the day are equal; the length of each of these hours is fifteen [equatorial] degrees. 
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
\mn{1.9}\textsl{The crooked among them are \Capricorn, \Aquarius, \Pisces, \Aries, \Taurus, and \Gemini, because each one of these six rises in less than two hours of the equinoctial hours.}
