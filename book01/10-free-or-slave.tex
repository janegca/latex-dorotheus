\section{Is the Person and their Mother Free or a Slaves}

First, examine the \Moon's condition. 

If the \Moon\, is in the 12th or 6th place and:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em, itemsep=0em]
\item the first triplicity lord of the place is in a bad place, the native is a slave, unless
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em, itemsep=0em]
\item it is a night chart and the \Moon's second and participating triplicity lords are in good places, or
\item it is a day chart and the first and second lords of the \Sun's tripicity are in good places, say the same
\end{itemize}
In which case the person is born free but his parents are poor.
\end{itemize}

If the \Moon\, is in the last degrees of a sign, the mother is of bad descent unless:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em, itemsep=0em]
\item  \Jupiter's aspect removes the misery, which happens even if \Jupiter\, is badly placed\footnote{The wording in the original is confusing, although this appears to be the author's intent.}, or

\item the \Moon\, is with \Venus\, in one of \Venus's domiciles in which case ``the evil'' disappears.
\end{itemize}

If a malefic is in one of the \Moon's angles\footnote{Either malefic found in the 4th, 7th, or 10th place from the \Moon.} and \Mars (in a day chart) or \Saturn\, (in a night chart) aspect the \Sun\, or \Moon\, without \Jupiter\, also being in aspect, the person will be a servant. And his condition may be worse if the \Moon\, is in a feminine sign and worse yet if \Venus\, is also injured.
