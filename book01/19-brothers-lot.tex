\section{Lot of Brothers}

To find the Lot of Brothers count (in the order of the signs) from \Saturn\, to \Jupiter\, by day or \Jupiter\, to \Saturn\, by night and add the difference to the Ascendant. A planet in or aspecting the lot will make clear matters concerning the brothers.

If the lot is in sterile signs (\Leo, \Virgo, \Capricorn) ``there is not good in his brothers'' while if it is in \Cancer, \Scorpio, or \Pisces, he will have numerous brothers.

\Jupiter\, and \Venus\, aspecting the lot, even by square, indicates good things in the matter of brothers.

\Mars\, or \Saturn\, aspecting the lot by square or opposition injures and diminishes the brothers and sometimes indicates they will die before the person. But if the malefics aspect by trine or sextile ``there is no great calamity'' for the brothers.
