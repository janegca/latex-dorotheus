Know the longitude and latitudes of the seven planets (\Sun,\Moon,\Mercury,\Venus\,\Mars,\Jupiter,\Saturn), the degrees of the Ascendant and MC, which signs are straight and crooked\footnote{The \textsl{straight} signs are those that appear to rise straight up from the horizon taking slightly more than two hours each: \Cancer\, thru \Sagittarius, the remaining signs are called \textsl{crooked} as they rise at an oblique angle to the horizon in slightly less than two hours.} in rising, and that the signs, their triplicities and rulers are:

\end{table}

The rulers of the triplicities give give indications for, and decide, everything.

In mundane astrology, the ``afflictions and distress'' that effect the world are timed and indicated by the triplicity rulers of a solar or lunar eclipse. Every hour that the \Sun\, is eclipsed is equal to one year while every hour that the \Moon\, is eclipsed is equal to one month. T

he sign of the solar eclipse gives indications as to who will suffer the afflcitions and distress: \Aries, sheep; \Sagittarius, work-horses and horses, \Leo, lions, etc.
