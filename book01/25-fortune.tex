\section{Excellence of Fortune}
Indications of an increased fortune:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item triplicity ruler of the sect light in a good place in \Conjunction, \Opposition, \Trine, or \Square\, the \Moon

\item Asc, MC, and 2nd place rulers not malefic, angular or succedent, ``in their places with benefics'' then the person ``will possess fortune, eminence, commendation, praise, and a good livelihood
\end{itemize}

Indications of a middling fortune:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item a benefic in its domicile, exaltation, or triplicity, not USB or retrograde, with its triplicity ruler aspecting the ascendent but not the \Moon

\item rulers of the Asc, MC, and 2nd neither all in good or bad places
\end{itemize}

Indications of a bad fortune:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the triplicity ruler of the sect averse to the ascendent, \Moon, the sect light and its dispositor, especially if \Jupiter, \Venus, and \Mercury\, are not in these places\footnote{Ascendant, place of \Moon, or sect light?} as it ``is more harmful and worse'' and indicates the person will not survive especially if \Saturn\, or \Mars\, are found there

\item rulers of the Asc, MC, and 2nd all cadent

\item rulers of all four angles (Asc, MC, 7th, 4th) and all four succedent (2nd, 8th, 11th, 5th) houses cadent with no aspect to the \Moon\, by night or \Sun\, by day, the person ``will be needing nourishment for his belly, and it will be worse for him if a malefic is in one of the cardines\footnote{Not sure the depicted situation is possible. \Mars\, rules \Aries\, and \Scorpio, which are six signs apart, so if one is cadent the other must be on an angle, and \Mars\, a ruler of an angle; if he was angular the condition of all angular rulers being cadent would fail. A similar problem arises with \Saturn, if \Aquarius\, is on an angle, \Capricorn\, must be cadent and if \Capricorn\, is on an angle, \Aquarius\, must be succedent, in either case, if \Saturn\, is angular it negates the condition that all rulers of angular and succedent places be cadent.}''
