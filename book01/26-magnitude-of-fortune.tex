\section{Magnitude of Fortune}

Examine the distance of the triplicity ruler of the sect light from the angles using unequal (oblique ascension) degrees and judge the magnitude of the fortune according to the following:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[0-15째] the person ``will be most perfect in fortune and property''
\item[15-30째] good fortune and property, ``the nearer to the degree of the cardine, the higher it is for his rank in eminence and fortune''
\item[30-45째] the person ``will not be known,...and middling in property and fortune''
\item[45째+]  the person ``will be needy [and] miserable''
\end{itemize}

``[You] should have these degrees in [the rising-time of] the ascendents because degrees are equal, thirty [to a sign], but the ascendents are not equal because some of them are crooked and some straight. And the crooked ones ae quicker in rising, the straight ones slow in rising; and their rising-tiems in every region and clime is not the same because the region of the vicinity of the North is long and square while the vicinity of the South is low [and] excessive[?].''

There is no good or pleasure for the person in his property, even though he thinks it might be good and will increase, if the triplicity rulers of the \Sun, by day, are in bad places and those of the \Moon\, are found in good places \textsl{[the opposite for a night birth?]}.

If the benefics ``have ameliorated'' \textsl{[are connected to?]} the ascendent and midheaven but there are malefics in the 7th without the aspect of benefics, the person ``will be well known [and] good in [his] condition, [but] then will fall from his fortune and his property quickly.''

If the malefics are angular, the benefics succedent, and the \Moon\, is separating from the malefics and moving to conjunct  benefics, the person ``will be at the beginning of their life despised [and] in disgrace, then they will attain property and fortune and joy.''

If the \textsl{[triplicity]} rulers of both the lights are in bad places look to the Lot of Fortune.

\subsection{Lot of Fortune}
By day, count from the \Sun\, to the \Moon\, in the order of the signs and add the result to the Ascendant. By night, count from the \Moon\, to the \Sun. Judge according to location of the lot, its ruler, and the aspects they are involved in.

If the lot is aspected by the sect light's sect mates ``then this is a good testimony with regard to fortune and property'' but if the lot is aspected by planets contrary to the chart sect ``then his livelihood is difficult and he will attain property after delay and despair.''

\noindent\textsc{Bad Indications:} \hfill \\
\indent If the lord of the lot is cadent, or in a bad place, or not aspecting the lot, or out of sect or invisible in the west,  or not aspecting the sect light, or in its dejection \textsl{[opposite its own domicile]} while not receiving an aspect from the benefics ``then judge for him [the native] calamity and misfortune in [his] condition,'' especially if the first triplicity ruler of the sect light is in a similar condition.

If the lot and its lord are in the 6th or 12th, USB, or aspected by malefics.

By day, \Mars\, conjunct, square or opposed to the lord of the lot.

The lord of the lot USB ``has no power to grant good.''

If the lord of the lot, \Jupiter, and \Venus\, are cadent it is a harmful indication and worse if the \Moon\, does not aspect the benefics. If at the same time the malefics are angular or succedent then the person ``will fall upon misfortunes and he will be injured according to that.''

\noindent\textsc{Middling Indications:} \hfill \\
If the lord of the lot is afflicted but eastern benefics in good places aspect it, the Ascendent and the \Moon\, the person will be ``middling with respect to property and livelihood because:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[\Jupiter] in a good place ``always indicates...good from nobles and mighty people and from well known work''
\item[\Venus] in a good place ``indicates benefit because of women''
\item[\Mercury] in a good place ``indicates benefit because of commerce and science and calculation'' and if mixed with \Jupiter\, the person ``will be a confident of kings and bands [of people]"
\end{itemize}

If the first triplicity ruler does not aspect the lot but the second one does, then some of the person's property ``will be squandered and some will remain.''

If both the lots triplicity rulers are averse to it while it receives aspects from both benefics and malefics ``then his livelihood is a mixture of good and bad.''

\noindent\textsc{Good Indications:} \hfill \\
If the lord of the lot is in the same sign as the lot or in the 5th, the person is ``happy and wealthy'' and it is even better if the lord aspects the lot.

``The best that is [possible] is if \Saturn\, witnesses the lord of the lot of fortune in aspect, and it witnesses \Jupiter\, or the \Sun\, by day\footnote{These three are sect mates.} and by night witnesses \Mars\, or \Venus\, or the \Moon\, or \Mercury\footnote{The \Moon, \Venus, and \Mars\, are sect mates; \Mercury\, appears to be treated as one as well.}; everything one considers will be good.''

``The best that is [possible] is if the lord of the lot of fortune is in its house or triplicity or exaltation or terms.''

If the lord of the lot is in a good place while being aspected by benefics that are also in good places, the person ``will be one of the kings and the free-born, greedy for righteousness, and he will be one of the mighty nobles'' but he ``will fall from his fortune'' if the malefics witness the lot or the benefics.

If the lot of Fortune is in a good place and in the terms of a benefic while being aspected by a benefic the person ``will acquire property from his own property and affluence.''

If both the lot's triplicity rulers are averse but a benefic aspects the lot the person will have ``a good livelihood from strangers together with praise and commendation.''

\subsection{Indications from the Malefics}
If \Saturn\, or \Mars\, is ``in a sign of property,''  especially in the 2nd, ``it indicates a fall from property and status'' unless their sect condition is good.

The same if they are in the 4th, especially if they are opposed to each other with no aspect from \Jupiter\, as ``flight or a terrible death or hard fall'' is indicated.

If \Mars\, is in the 11th the person ``will fall from his property...as destruction and weakness'' are indicated while a benefic in the 11th indicates ``the acquisition of property unexpectedly.''
