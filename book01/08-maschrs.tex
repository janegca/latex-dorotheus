\section{Masculine and Feminine Hours}

The person represented by the chart will be a male if:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em, itemsep=0em]
\item the  \Moon\, is in a masculine dodecatemorion
 \newline\newline
To determine the dodecatemoria divide the sign into 2.5° sections\footnote{Dorotheus says ``two and a half days'', we are basically dividing the 30° of each sign by 12 so it has an analogy with each month of 30 days being equivalent to a sign and the 12 signs being equivalent to a year.} with, in a masculine sign, the sections running male, female, male, female, etc. In a feminine sign, the sections running female, male, female, etc\footnote{For more information on the  \textsl{dodecatemoria} see the Appendix  \textsl{\S\ref{appendix:dodecatemoria} Dodecatemoria} to see how they are calculated.}

\item the \Sun, \Moon, and Ascendant are all in masculine signs

\item the \Sun\, in the ascendant in a masculine sign, even if the hour of the birth is ``double'' (even)

\item a masculine planet in the ascendant in a ``two-bodied'' masculine sign (\Gemini, \Sagittarius), even if the hour of the birth is ``double'' (even)

\item a masculine planet in the 1st and in the 7th,  even if the hour of the birth is ``double'' (even) 

\item the \Sun\, and \Moon, both in masculine signs, and \Jupiter\, ruling the Ascendant regardless of gender of the sign on the Ascendant

\end{itemize}
