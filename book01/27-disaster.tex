\section{The Decline of Status and Disaster}

A ``fall from fortune and property'' is indicated if \Saturn\, and the \Moon\, are together in an angle; if \Mars\, aspects them ``it will be a disaster.'' If \Jupiter\, is with them ``the property and fortune will remain for some time, but after that will decline\footnote{The text adds ``even if \Jupiter\, is aspecting'' but that makes little sense as we've already been told \Jupiter\, must be in the angle with \Saturn\, and \Mars.}.''

\subsection{2nd Place}
A malefic in the 2nd place or throwing its opposition or square to it indicates a ``decline in property and livelihood.''

The condition of the ruler of the 2nd gives indications as to the extent of the decline:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item bad if the ruler is a malefic in a bad place
\item middling if the ruler is a benefic in a bad place
\item ``sometimes the misery is diminished'' if the ruler is a benefic in a good place in the aspect of a malefic
\item if the ruler is in a bad place, harming the 2nd or other malefics harm the 2nd then the person will be ``always anxious about [their] livelihood and have little joy, [but are] filled with grief and misery and misfortune and calamity, and they seek everything in misery and suffering and little profit, so that [even] if it is the nativity of a king, his money will be spent on inferior thing[s].
\end{itemize}

If the 2nd place is in relatively good condition, the \Moon\, will enhance that good if she is waxing, in a good place aspecting the 2nd, trine the \Sun\, and unaspected by \Mars, making the person ``well known, mighty in his leadership and work in cities and the service of kings, a confidant of them, [and] influential because of this.''

But if the 2nd is in bad condition and the \Moon\, is waning then the condition is worsened further and the person will ``not present his management in a favorable light nor will they have praise.''

The manner of the disaster is given by the ruler of the 2nd:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[\Venus] as a result of the person's reputation among women

\item[\Mercury] due to ``a book or calculation''

\item[\Jupiter] due to the action of a noble, a king, or the government

\item[\Mars] because of a violent act, anger, thieves, or fire

\item[\Saturn] due to ``mature men and slaves'', from ``one who is free...with no commendation or praise,'' or from someone whose life is a misery and full of misfortune, or ``with respect to a building'' or funeral home

\item[\Sun] due to his father or his wife or the mother's husband or to debt

\item[\Moon] from his mother or her relatives or because of his father's wives
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lot of Livelihood}
The Lot of Livelihood is taken from the lord of the 2nd to the 2nd place \textsl{[cusp?]} and projected from the Ascendant. The condition of the livelihood is indicated by the conditon of the lot and its lords, their location and aspects.

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item good if the lot's ruler is in a good place in the aspect of benefics

\item wealth and riches if the lot's ruler is an angular benefic in its ``own place''\footnote{Not clear if this is limited to domicile or includes exaltation, triplicity, or term.}. If the ruler is not rising from the \Sun (or will not rise within 7 days) the person will be rich but not famous or known for his wealth

\item great misery if the lord is a malefic in the aspect of another malefic

\item the lot in a good place and the lot's ruler rising, the wealth lasts for a long time

\item the lot in a good place but the lot's ruler USB, what the lot indicates only remains for a little while

\item if the lot is in a bad place the person's livelihood will not increase or be much to speak of
\end{itemize}

``If \mn{retrograde} you find the planets retrograde in a nativity in which the planets are strong, then he will be distressed, a coward. If it is thus in a bad nativity, then his condition [tends] toward deterioration\footnote{Not clear if he is talking about the planets connected to the lot or all the planets in general.}.''
