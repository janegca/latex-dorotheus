\section{The Decline of Status}

A ``fall from fortune and property'' is indicated if \Saturn\, and the \Moon\, are together in an angle; if \Mars\, aspects them ``it will be a disaster.'' If \Jupiter\, is with them ``the property and fortune will remain for some time, but after that will decline\footnote{The text adds ``even if \Jupiter\, is aspecting'' but that makes little sense as we've already been told \Jupiter\, must be in the angle with \Saturn\, and \Mars.}.''

\subsection{2nd Place}
A malefic in the 2nd place or throwing its opposition or square to it indicates a ``decline in property and livelihood.''

The condition of the ruler of the 2nd gives indications as to the extent of the decline:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item bad if the ruler is a malefic in a bad place
\item middling if the ruler is a benefic in a bad place
\item ``sometimes the misery is diminished'' if the ruler is a benefic in a good place in the aspect of a malefic
\item if the ruler is in a bad place, harming the 2nd or other malefics harm the 2nd then the person will be ``always anxious about [their] livelihood and have little joy, [but are] filled with grief and misery and misfortune and calamity, and they seek everything in misery and suffering and little profit, so that [even] if it is the nativity of a king, his money will be spent on inferior thing[s].
\end{itemize}

If the 2nd place is in relatively good condition, the \Moon\, will enhance that good if she is waxing, in a good place aspecting the 2nd, trine the \Sun\, and unaspected by \Mars, making the person ``well known, mighty in his leadership and work in cities and the service of kings, a confidant of them, [and] influential because of this.''

But if the 2nd is in bad condition and the \Moon\, is waning then the condition is worsened further and the person will ``not present his management in a favorable light nor will they have praise.''

The manner of the disaster is given by the ruler of the 2nd:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[\Venus] as a result of the person's reputation among women

\item[\Mercury] due to ``a book or calculation''

\item[\Jupiter] due to the action of a noble, a king, or the government

\item[\Mars] because of a violent act, anger, thieves, or fire

\item[\Saturn] due to ``mature men and slaves'', from ``one who is free...with no commendation or praise,'' or from someone whose life is a misery and full of misfortune, or ``with respect to a building'' or funeral home

\item[\Sun] due to his father or his wife or the mother's husband or to debt

\item[\Moon] from his mother or her relatives or because of his father's wives
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lot of Livelihood}
The Lot of Livelihood is taken from the lord of the 2nd to the 2nd place \textsl{[cusp?]} and projected from the Ascendant. The condition of the livelihood is indicated by the conditon of the lot and its lords, their location and aspects.

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item good if the lot's ruler is in a good place in the aspect of benefics

\item wealth and riches if the lot's ruler is an angular benefic in its ``own place''\footnote{Not clear if this is limited to domicile or includes exaltation, triplicity, or term.}. If the ruler is not rising from the \Sun\, (or will not rise within 7 days) the person will be rich but not famous or known for his wealth

\item great misery if the lord is a malefic in the aspect of another malefic

\item the lot in a good place and the lot's ruler rising, the wealth lasts for a long time

\item the lot in a good place but the lot's ruler USB, what the lot indicates only remains for a little while

\item if the lot is in a bad place the person's livelihood will not increase or be much to speak of
\end{itemize}

``If \mn{retrograde} you find the planets retrograde in a nativity in which the planets are strong, then he will be distressed, a coward. If it is thus in a bad nativity, then his condition [tends] toward deterioration\footnote{Not clear if he is talking about the planets connected to the lot or of planets in general.}.''

\subsection{Benefics Angular or Succedent}
If \Jupiter\, is in an angle or succedent place, even in a bad nativity, any injury indicated by malefics ``becomes insignificant and the misfortunes dissolve; even if \textsl{[the person]} does not attain a good livelihood, yet he will achieve something because of the position of \Jupiter\,'' and similarly for \Venus\, except its effect for good will not be as strong except ``in the matter of women, there will be seen for him some participation in livelihood and pleasure.''

If the benefics are also in their own places ``they indicate good and beauty in cities and groups of men because many are his acquaintances and friends, and sometimes his enemy will turn to agreeing with him so that they will become friends with him, especially \mndl if these two planets are in their places aspecting'' the chart's sect light ``because this increases their strength and their efficacy and their steadfastness.''

\subsection{Malefics Angular or Succedent}
If ``\Mars, the murderous one, or \Saturn, the destroyer'' are angular or succedent they ``indicate the severance of \textsl{[the person's]} upbringing, and that, even if the work of the native is good among men, all will not be grateful to him nor will they praise him, bu one whom he did not harm in anything will treat him as an enemy until he shall see from the generality of men grief and sorrow. If he is a king, then his people and his city will be destroyed for him and will fall into discord and quarrel[s] and necessity. Similarly predict in the case of middling and inferior nativities because the sons of his paternal uncle and his kinfolk will treat him as an enemy, and he also will not love anyone of them.''

If \Saturn\, is angular or succedent then the person ``will be reflective and anxious, ugly, malicious, [and] haughty to himself and those who mingle with him.''

If \Mars\, is angular or succedent then the person will be insolent, ``a laborer insignificant in his thought and reflection.''

Both \Saturn\, and \Mars\, are less harmful if \Jupiter\, or \Venus\,  aspect them.

Look to see which planet will be the first after birth to reach the Ascendant or \Moon\, as it will most clearly indicate ``the matter of fortune and \textsl{[the person's]} property and what the extent is.''
