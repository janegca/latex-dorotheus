\section{Parent Deaths}

Indications of which parent will probably die first:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the parental lot that contains a malefic or is in its square or opposition

\item \Mars\Square\Sun\, from the left\footnote{Dykes says ``That is, overcoming the \Sun'' although usually ``overcoming'' is described as on the ``right''; essentially, the \Mars\, must be in square from the 10th from the \Sun, not square in the the fourth sign from the \Sun.}, the father is indicated; if the \Moon\, is in a similar situation, then the mother is indicated

\item \Mars\, in the 2nd place from the \Sun\, (indicates the father) of the \Moon\, (indicates the mother)

\item the \Sun\, (father) or \Moon\, (mother) square or opposed to a strong malefic

\item if both the Lot of the Mother and the Lot of the Father are in the square or opposition of malefics without the aspect of the benefics\footnote{The text has ``but [the two lots] not aspecting any of them [the malefics]'' but that makes little sens; Dykes has ``and $<$the fortunes$>$ not looking at them'' (the lots).} see which of the \Sun\, or \Moon\, will first enter the 4th place by diurnal motion

\item if both the lights are injured by malefics look to the SAN ``as this will indicate to you whatever of that you wish''\footnote{He doesn't say which parent is indicated by the new or full \Moon.  New \Moon, mother?}

\item if a light is below the horizon and malefics aspect the Ascendant then the parent indicated by the light will die first
\end{itemize}

\Saturn\Opposition\Mars\, or \Mars\, overcoming \Saturn\,  is an indication the father's property will be destroyed.

The time of death is shown by the lots. If \Saturn\, transits the lot and \Jupiter\, is in an angle, the person will inherit their father's property at his death.

If \Saturn\, and \Mars\, transit the sign where both lights are then both parents will die.
