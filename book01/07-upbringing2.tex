\section{More on Upbringing}

\subsection{Good Upbringing}
\label{sec:upbringing2}
The person will be brought up if diurnal planets in a diurnal chart or nocturnal planets in a nocturnal chart are found in:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
\item one or more of the seven strong places; it is beneficial if one of them is a benefic

\item the 2nd place from the ascending sign if the planet is within 15° of the Ascendant as then ``reckon its power as if it were in the ascendent''
\end{itemize}

\subsection{No Upbringing}
The person may not be brought up or have a harsh upbringing if:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
\item the first triplicity ruler is within 15° of the \Sun\, or in a bad place; especially if the second triplicity ruler is with him

\item both malefics aspect the \Moon, especially if she is in an angle and one of the malefics is in opposition while also making an exact aspect to the Ascendant\footnote{Dykes indicates it could be an aspect to the Ascendant's terms rather an exact aspect to the Ascendant's degree (CAD p.69).} as ``this is an indications of ruin''

\item the \Moon\, in the 7th place with no connection to a benefic and while a malefic is in an angle for ``then the women give birth to what has no escape from ruin''

\item the \Moon, not in her own places, in the 4th with \Saturn\, and \Mars\, or in their opposition

\item one of the malefics in the Ascendant opposite the other malefic and the \Moon\, in the 10th or 7th

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rejection or Exposure}
The person may be cast out by his parents if:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \Moon\, in the 4th place with \Saturn\, and \Mars\, or in their opposition unless the \Moon\, is in her own triplicity and the benefics are trine the malefics in which case, rather than ruin, the person is brought up by strangers and sometimes they ``will be a slav and will be employed and then will be miserable''

\item the \Moon\, ``between the two malefics and one them casts its rays upon it'' then the person's livelihood will be little and if the \Moon\, is also waning ``it indicates fate and shortness of life'' which he may escape if a benefic is also part of the configuration

\item the \Moon\, is with a malefic in an angular or succedent place and is configured with a benefic and if the \Sun\, aspects the malefics, the father favours casting him out and thinks badly of him; if the \Moon\, is injured\footnote{This is odd as we've already been told the \Moon\, must be with a malefic, which would be an injury; possibly it must also be harmed by the other malefic?}, the mother wants to cast the person out; if both lights are injured, both parents want rid of the person

\item in a diurnal chart, \Mars\, angular and opposing the \Moon\, or the \Sun\, while they are not in their own places; in a nocturnal chart, \Saturn\, under the same conditions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Calamity}

If the \Moon\, is in the term of a malefic without the aspect of a benefic while a malefic is in an angle there is ``calamity'' for the person unless first ruler of the sect light's triplcity aspects the \Moon.

\subsection{Injury to the person and his mother}

If there is no benefic in (a) an angle, (b) in the same sign as the Lot of Fortune, or (c) in a sign of the same triplicity as the Ascendant while malefics aspect the \Sun, \Moon, and SAN\footnote{The most recent new or full moon that occurred prior to the birth.} the indications are evil.

If a benefic does not aspect the Ascendant (representing the person) or the \Moon, an unfortunate condition is indicated for the person and their mother if the \Moon, or worse yet, the \Moon\, and \Venus\, (as both indicate the mother) are injured.
