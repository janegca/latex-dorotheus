\section{How many will own the person}

In a day chart, if slavery is indicated, to know how many will own the person count the planets between the \Sun\, and the lord of the triplicity of the Lot of Fortune. In a nocturnal chart count from the \Moon\, instead of the \Sun.

If the \Moon\, is above the earth count the planets between the 6th place (the sign of slaves) to the 12th place and if the \Moon\, is under the earth, count the planets between the 12th and the 6th.

And if any planet is in a double-bodied sign (\Gemini,\Virgo, \Sagittarius, \Pisces) count it as two planets instead of one.

To know how many would own the father, count from the \Sun\, to the lord of the \Sun's triplicity, and for the mother, count from the \Moon\, to the lord of the \Moon's triplicity.
