\section{Number of Siblings}

To know how many siblings were born before the person examine the Ascendant's triplicity rulers and see where the stronger one falls in the chart:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em, itemsep=0em]
\item in the 1st, the person is the first\footnote{Dorotheus says ``the cardines indicate the beginning.''} born
\item in the 10th, the person is the fourth born or the first born
\item in the 7th, he is the seventh child or the first
\item both triplicity rulers cadent, ``sometimes nothing is allotted''
\end{itemize}

If both the triplicity rulers are on the left side of the Ascendant, under the Earth, look at what is between the triplicity rulers and the Ascendant:
\begin{itemize}
\item a malefic indicates the mother had a miscarriage or that a sibling born before the person has a birthmark or defect
\item a benefic, direct, rising from the \Sun, indicates there will be more siblings than predicted
\item if no planets are found in-between, the person is the first born and if they are not, it indicates the sibling born before them was a miscarriage or will die before them
\end{itemize}

If there is a planet between the Ascendant and the IC there will be a sibling born after the person and if that planet is a malefic, they will die. If there are no planets found, there are no siblings born after the person.
