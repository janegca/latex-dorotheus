Don't worry for the person's life because you see a malefic in an angle, there are conditions involving the triplicity rulers of the Ascendant that can increase and strengthen the life. 

Mitigating conditions include:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]

\item a triplicity ruler in its own term and angular or in another place where it is strong\footnote{It is not clear what he means by ``strong'' placement; could be by sign, degrees, or good places which he calls \textsl{powerful} in \S1.5.}

\item all three triplicity rulers in strong places

\item two triplicity rulers in strong places, preferably with the first triplicity ruler in a good place\footnote{The \textsl{good places} are given in \S1.5.}

\item all three triplicity rulers in strong places and square or trine each other, and its even better if they aspect the \Sun\, or \Moon, or both 

\item if \Saturn, \Mars, or both are actually in the Ascendant look to see if all three of the Ascendant's triplicity rulers are in strong places and ``coming out in their light''\footnote{This usually means the planet is moving from conjunction with the \Sun\ to its opposition and there is 15° to 120° between the two, the planet is usually said to be strongest (or in its own 'glow' or 'light') when it is 60° from the conjunction with the \Sun\ and moving towards its opposition.}
\end{itemize}

If the triplicity lords of the Ascendant are in a ``sign of misfortune''\footnote{The places of \textsl{misfortune} are the 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 8th or 12th places from the Ascendant , they are described in \S1.5.} check the first\footnote{This is an assumption on my part as the first triplicity lord rules the first part of the life, which is when \textsl{upbringing} occurs.} triplicity lord of the Lot of Fortune. If it aspects the lot or is in a good place and aspecting the \Sun\, for day births, the \Moon\, for night births, then the person will be brought up.

Other conditions that indicate the person will be brought up are:

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
\item \Jupiter\, in the Ascendant or in a sign that is of the same triplicity as the sign of the Ascendant 

\item \Jupiter\, in the 2nd place from the Ascendant

\item \Jupiter\, in the 4th place with the \Moon\, and \Mercury\, both in the Ascendant

\item in a day chart, \Saturn, \Jupiter, and \Mercury\, in angles

\item in a day chart, \Saturn\, angular and in his own triplicity
\end{itemize}
