\section{Upbringing}

Don't worry for the person's life because you see a malefic in an angle, there are conditions involving the triplicity rulers of the Ascendant that can increase and strengthen the life. 

Mitigating conditions include:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]

\item a triplicity ruler in its own term and angular or in another place where it is strong\footnote{Not clear if this refers to the planet being strong by sign or by being in strong degrees.}

\item all three triplicity rulers in strong places

\item two triplicity rulers in strong places, preferably with the first triplicity ruler in a good place\footnote{The \textsl{good} places are the 1st, 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th, 10th, and 11th places from the Ascendant.}

\item all three triplicity rulers in strong places and square or trine each other, and its even better if they aspect the \Sun\, or \Moon, or both 

\item if \Saturn, \Mars, or both are actually in the Ascendant look to see if all three of the Ascendant's triplicity rulers are in strong places and ``coming out in their light''\footnote{This usually means the \Sun\, must be moving away from a conjunction with the planet such that there is 15 to 120Â° between them.}
\end{itemize}

If the triplicity lords of the Ascendant are in a ``sign of misfortune''\footnote{The places of \textsl{misfortune} are the 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 8th or 12th places from the Ascendant.} the check the triplicity lord of the Lot of Fortune. If it aspects the lot or is in a good place and aspecting the \Sun\, for day births, the \Moon\, for night births, then the person will be brought up.

Other conditions that indicate the person will be brought up are:

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
\item \Jupiter\, in the Ascendant or in a sign that is of the same triplicity as the sign of the Ascendant 

\item \Jupiter\, in the 2nd place from the Ascendant

\item \Jupiter\, in the 4th place with the \Moon\, and \Mercury\, both in the Ascendant

\item in a day chart, \Saturn, \Jupiter, and \Mercury\, in angles

\item in a day chart, \Saturn\, angular and in his own triplicity
\end{itemize}
