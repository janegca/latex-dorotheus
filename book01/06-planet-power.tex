\section{Power of the Seven Planets}

Every planet in its own sign, exaltation, or triplicity is benefic as ``what it indicates of good is strong, increasing.'' This is true even of malefics as their ``evil becomes lighter and decreases'' when they are in their own places.

\Saturn\, in a masculine sign\footnote{In \S1.4 we are told \Saturn\,(a diurnal planet) is at his worst when in a feminine sign. Here we are told he can still do harm when in a masculine sign but not as much and even less if he is in one of his own dignities. In the same section, \Mars\, (a nocturnal planet) in a feminine sign is described as less harmful than a feminized \Saturn.} in a day chart (even though he is a diurnal planet) can cause harm but it will be less harmful if he is also in one of his own dignities. The same is true for \Mars, a nocturnal planet, in a feminine sign in a nocturnal chart. 

A planet's power \textsl{disappears} if it is within 15Â° of the \Sun\, while the \Sun\, is moving towards a conjunction with the planet.

A retrograde planet indicates ``there is difficulty [and] misfortune'' for the person and others.
