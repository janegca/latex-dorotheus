\subsection{Moon on the 3rd Day after Birth}
Check the sign the \Moon\, is in on the third day after birth and consider:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the place the sign occupies
\item the planets aspecting the sign
\item the place and condition of the sign's domicile  and exaltation rulers
\end{itemize}

\noindent The person's condition is good and fortunate if:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the places occupied are good and in the aspect of benefics
\end{itemize}

\noindent The person's condition is middling, he is ``neither happy nor destitute'' if:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the domicile ruler is in a good place, not USB, or in the aspect of benefics
\end{itemize}

\noindent The person's condition is miserable if:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the places occupied are bad and aspected by malefics
\item malefics aspect the domicile ruler
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Indications from the radix Moon}
The person's condition is good if:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the dodecatemoria of the \Moon\, with benefics or in their aspect\footnote{This is implied from his comments on the dodecatemoria causing misery.}
\end{itemize}

\noindent The person's condition is unfortunate if:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the dodecatemoria of the \Moon\, with malefics or in their aspect
\item the \Moon\, is void\footnote{There are two current ideas of what what determines if the \Moon\, is \textsl{Void of Course}. The most widely used interpretation is the \Moon\, not applying to aspect any planet within the next 30Â° of her travel. Others limit it to her not applying to the aspect of another planet while she moves through the sign she occupies at birth.}, no planets in or aspecting the Ascendant\footnote{Dykes has the \Moon\, not in or aspecting the Ascendant.}; the  person will possess ``pain and hardship in the pursuit of what he needs''
\item the \Moon\, is waxing and is \Conjunction, \Opposition, or \Square\, to \Mars
\item the \Moon\, is waning and is \Conjunction, \Opposition, or \Square\, to \Saturn
\end{itemize}
