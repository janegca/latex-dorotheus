\subsection{Moon on the 3rd Day after Birth}
Check the sign the \Moon\, is in on the third day after birth and consider:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the place the sign occupies
\item the planets aspecting the sign
\item the place and condition of the sign's domicile  and exaltation rulers
\end{itemize}

\noindent The person's condition is good and fortunate if:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the places occupied are good and in the aspect of benefics
\end{itemize}

\noindent The person's condition is middling, he is ``neither happy nor destitute'' if:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the domicile ruler is in a good place, not USB, or in the aspect of benefics
\end{itemize}

\noindent The person's condition is miserable if:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the places occupied are bad and aspected by malefics
\item malefics aspect the domicile ruler
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Indications from the radix Moon}
The person's condition is good if:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the dodecatemoria of the \Moon\, with benefics or in their aspect\footnote{This is implied from his comments on the dodecatemoria causing misery.}

\item the \Moon\, is waxing and moving North\footnote{It is not clear if this is North in latitude or North in the sense that Valens describes it under winds in Book 3.4.} the person ``attains good at the end of his life''

\item the \Moon\, ascending, moving from South to North, then ``he attains good at the beginning of his life and at the end''; it is best if 

\item it is best if the \Moon\, waxing and ascending North as it is an indication of prosperity and virtue
\end{itemize}

\noindent The person's condition is unfortunate if:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the dodecatemoria of the \Moon\, with malefics or in their aspect
\item the \Moon\, is void\footnote{There are two current ideas of what what determines if the \Moon\, is \textsl{Void of Course}. The most widely used interpretation is the \Moon\, not applying to aspect any planet within the next 30Â° of her travel. Others limit it to her not applying to the aspect of another planet while she moves through the sign she occupies at birth.}, no planets in or aspecting the Ascendant\footnote{Dykes has the \Moon\, not in or aspecting the Ascendant.}; the  person will possess ``pain and hardship in the pursuit of what he needs''
\item the \Moon\, is waxing and is \Conjunction, \Opposition, or \Square\, to \Mars
\item the \Moon\, is waning and is \Conjunction, \Opposition, or \Square\, to \Saturn
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Indications from the 10th Place from the Moon}

If there is a benefic in the 10th place from the \Moon, there is good for the person. If the benefic is in their own places then the person ``attains wealth and gains in right and honesty.''

If there is a malefic in the 10th place from the \Moon, the good is less and if the malefic is not in his own places then the indication is for ``great harm.''

\subsection{Indications for the Parents}
The \Sun\, and his triplicity rulers indicate the father and his end and the \Moon\, and her triplicity rulers indicate the mother, her end, and the native. The lord of the 4th is also an indicator for the parents.

If the \Sun\, and his triplicity lords and the \Moon\, are in bad places then both the mother and father will have ``misery and little livelihood'' and that the person ``will not be brought up'' but harmed by his parents. If, at the same time, there is a benefic in an angle, the misery will be held off for a period equal to the benefic's minor years.

If the \Sun\, is in a good place with the aspects of both malefics and benefics, it indicates a doubling of the father's property ``but also the diminuation of the property'' of the person. The same happens re: the mother if the \Moon\, is in a similar condition. And the loss will be worse if the ruler of the 4th is also harmed.

If the \Sun\, and/or \Moon\, is cadent and aspected by malefics then the father, or mother, or both are slaves, living in poverty and in need of ``nourishment day by day'' and if, along with this, the Ascendant ruler is also cadent ``then the native is not brough up out of misery and expulsion because he is a slave or a pauper or one in need of nourishment.''

\subsection{Indications for the Father from the Sun}

If the \Sun\, and the \Sun's first triplicity ruler are in good places then:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em, itemsep=0em]
\item wealth, praise, and fame is indicated for the father
\item it is better if the \Sun\, is also in the terms of a benefic as it means the person will inherit from their father
\item if the triplicity ruler is with a malefic there is an decrease in the father's property and ``injuries and calamities''
\end{itemize}

\noindent If the \Sun\, and the \Sun's first triplicity ruler are in bad places then:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em, itemsep=0em]
\item the father ``is not noble and poverty and necessity have overtaken him''
\end{itemize}

\noindent If the \Sun\, is in a good place but the first triplicity ruler is cadent, then:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em, itemsep=0em]
\item the father ``is noble, but he will not keep his property and honor''

\item if the \Sun\, is also in the term so malefic, his father ``has no splendor because [this is] an indication of service for him'' and if a malefic  also aspects the \Sun,  there will also be illness for his father
\end{itemize}

\noindent If the \Sun\, is iin a bad place but the first triplicity ruler is in a good place, the father increases and both the person and his father are elevated over their peers.

If the first triplicity ruler of the \Sun\, is in a strong place and the second triplicity ruler is in a bad place, his father is in good condition when the person is born but they do not persist; and the reverse is  true if the first triplicity ruler is in a bad place and the second in a good place.

The \Sun\, and its first triplicity ruler in a bad place, in its ``dejection'' or other signs not its own, ``then it indicates death in a terrible place for his father'' and if, at the same time, a malefic is \Square\, or in \Opposition, ``all the property of his mother and father will be squandered.''

\subsection{Indications for the Mother from the Moon}
Things are bad for the mother if:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em, itemsep=0em]
\item the \Moon\, is descending South, or
\item in an eclipse, or
\item in the terms of a malefic, or
\item in its \textsl{dejection} (Fall?)
\end{itemize}
and if a malefic also aspects the \Moon, it is worse.

If the \Moon\, is in the terms of a benefic and any of the above conditions apply, then ``the mother is noble, but ignominy and disdain and humiliation have struck her.''

If the \Moon\, is in the 4th ``a chronic illness will strike [the] mother or she will be harmed in her reputation.''

If the \Moon\, is in the 4th or 7th, in the terms of a malefic, and her dispositor is cadent, she ``is in slavery.''

If the \Moon\, is angular and is in \Conjunction, \Square, or in \Opposition\, to \Saturn\, or \Mars, then the person's mother ``will die a terrible death.''

If the \Moon\, and her triplicity rulers are in bad places, and the \Sun\, and its triplicity rulers are in good places then the mother has a bad end but not the father.
