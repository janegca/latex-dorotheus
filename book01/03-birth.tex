\section{Ease or Difficulty of the Birth}

If the \Sun, \Moon, and Ascendant are in masculine signs (for males) or feminine signs (for females) then the birth was an easy one for the mother. If you find the reverse then there is ``misery and death.'' 

In particular, \Saturn\, angular in a feminine sign has an intense power to make the birth slow, difficult, and unfortunate.

If \Mars\, is angular, especially if he is in a feminine sign, the birth will come upon the mother unexpectedly but generally it is easier because \Mars\, cuts.

The mother will have a difficult time if:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0.5em, itemsep=0.5em]
\item the \Moon\, is in a crooked sign (\Aries,\Taurus,\Gemini,\Capricorn,\Aquarius,\Pisces) and aspected by \Saturn\, or \Mars

\item the \Moon\, is in an angle and aspected by both \Saturn\, and \Mars, who are both in crooked signs

\item both \Saturn\, and \Mars\, are in angles and neither the \Sun\, nor the \Moon\, aspects the Ascendant
\end{itemize}
