\section{Lot of the Father}

Calculate the Lot of the Father, by degrees, in a day chart from the the \Sun\, to \Saturn; for a night chart, count from \Saturn\, to the \Sun\,. Add the degrees found to the Ascendant, the result is the place of the lot.

If \Saturn\, is USB, use from \Mars\, to \Jupiter\ in place of \Saturn\, and the \Sun.

If the lot ruler is in any of the good places, then the father's condition is good; if it is in the 6th, 8th, 3rd, or 12th\footnote{Probably should include the 2nd place as well.} his father's condition is bad.

If the lot's ruler is in the sign following the lot\footnote{In the 12th sign from the lot.}, not aspecting\footnote{Pingree's text omits the ``not'' but that would contradict what Dorotheus said about the condition of the father being good if the lot ruler is in a good place, all of which would aspect the lot.} the lot, or if the ruler of the sign opposite the lot is in the lot, then the person's father is not his real father.
