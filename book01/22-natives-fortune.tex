\section{The Native's Fortune, Property and Illness}
To discover the utmost limit of the native's fortune and status, look at the sect light and its triplicity lords.

If the 1st and 2nd lords are in good places ``then his condition will not cease from the beginning of his age to the end of his life to be in excellence and elevation and wealth.''

If the 1st is in a good place and the 2nd in a bad place ``then his condition will be better in the beginning of his age, but will degenerate at the end of his life.''

If the 1st is in a bad place and the 2nd in a good place ``then it indicates middling good in his life, but this will not last in him.''

If the 1st is in a bad place and the 2nd is under the earth or in a bad place, ``then some misfortunes reach him and he does not have every desire, but some forbearance against calamity and grief and loss in livelihood is inevitably his.''

If you find both cadent, ``then this will not cease being in misery and poverty, especially if the malefics aspect these two from quartile or opposition and the malefics are in cardines; whoever is thus will not find bread to fill his belly or clothes in which to clothe himself.''

If the triplicity lord is USB or in the place of \Saturn, ``then whatever of good it indicates is not stable, and his property will not increase, and he will be more learned in meditation than he is in work.''
