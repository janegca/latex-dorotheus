\section{Person's Inheritance}

\subsection{The Father's Property}
The father's property is indicated by the \Sun\, and \Saturn.

In a day chart, if they are both in good places, the person will inherit his father's property. He will also hold on to it if  the benefics aspect the \Sun\, alone or both the \Sun\, and \Saturn.

If  \Mars\ is \Square\, the \Sun\, the person will squander his inhertiance. 

The person will waste his father's property both before and after his father's death if the \Sun\, is in the 6th or 12th, or, \Mars\, is in an angle and especially if, in a day chart, \Saturn\, is in his dejection\footnote{Probably means \Saturn\, is in his Fall (\Aries).}. The grief from the loss will be mitigated if \Jupiter\, aspects.

The father will die a terrible death if:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the lord of the Lot of the Father is in a bad place and in the aspect of a malefic posited in the 4th or 7th.

\item the lord of the Lot of the Father in a bad place and neither the \Sun\, nor the lord of the \Sun\, aspecting the Ascendant
\end{itemize}

Indications for the relationship between a father and son:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]

\item  \Jupiter\, overcoming \Saturn; the father will be miserable because of his son.

\item \Jupiter\Opposition\Sun; ``misery and misfortune'' between the father and son

\item \Saturn\, in the triplicity of \Jupiter; they love each other and the son will inherit his father's property
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Mother's Property}
The mother's property is shown by the \Moon\, and \Venus\, and their lords.

The the \Moon\, and \Venus\, are in the west, in a bad place, and the \Sun\, is cadent without a good aspect to relieve the \Moon, \Venus, or the bad place then the person is born to parents who are poor and needy, and so is the person.
