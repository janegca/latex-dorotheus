# latex-dorotheus

A re-formatted, re-worked version of David Pingree's original translation of Dorotheus of Sidon's "Carmen Astrologicum".

There are a number of copies of the original text online, rather than re-type the original I've decided to re-work it for easier reference so fair warning, well I plan on keeping the text's original structure the text will not be a straight copy.

If you want the original text try these sites:

- Pingree's original text on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/PingreeDS1976).

- David French's copy of Pingree's translation on [Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/36454527/Dorotheus_of_Sidon_CARMEN_ASTROLOGICUM_translated_by_David_Pingree).

- Deborah Houlding's copies of [Book I](https://www.skyscript.co.uk/dorotheus1.pdf), [Book II](https://www.skyscript.co.uk/dorotheus2.pdf), and [Book III](https://www.skyscript.co.uk/dorotheus3.pdf) with her [notes on Book III](https://www.skyscript.co.uk/dorotheus3notes.pdf).
