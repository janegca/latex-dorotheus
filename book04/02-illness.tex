\mn{1.65}\textsl{Now I will make clear to you a section on chronic illness.}
\end{quote}

Look \mn{1.66} at the 6th sign from the Ascendant and determine if their nature is humane (\Gemini, \Virgo, \Libra, \Aquarius, and the 1st half of \Sagittarius), quadruped (\Aries, \Taurus, \Leo,  \Capricorn), or wild (\Leo, last half of \Sagittarius). And look at the sign's ruler, its nature and condition.

If \mn{1.67} the sign and its ruler are both in bad condition and they are both moist, \textsl{``then disasters will reach this native from pain due to moisture and cold and pain in his joints, and a long-lasting pain will seize him.''}

If \mn{1.68-69} the sign is \Aries\, or \Scorpio\, (ruled by \Mars) , \textsl{``then a cutting with iron will reach him, and he will be burned in a fire, or dogs or lions will bite him, and some of them will be transfixed by a spear, and many disasters will reach him. These are the disasters if this planet is shining [and] luminous, but if this is covered up under the \Sun's light then pain or torment will reach him, and his belly will be split, and he will die from this.''}

If \mn{1.71-74} \Mars\, is in a sign ruled by \Jupiter, the native will love wine and the disasters will be from his liver. 

If \Mars\, is in a sign ruled by \Venus, the disasters will be from the love of women, \textsl{``their malady will seize him like the form of a madman, his reason and his [sense of ] shame will depart in the search for women; it will be worse for this [native] if \Venus\, is in a masculine sign.''}

If \Mars\, is in a sign ruled by \Mercury, \textsl{``then the reputation of this native will be spoiled and his words, and he will not be about to speak except in misery, and his hearing will decrease, and wretchedness in his throat will seize him.''}

If \Mars\, is in \Leo\, or \Cancer, or his own domicile, \textsl{``then a chronic illness in his eyes will reach him, and a pain in his heart will reach him from the \Sun, and a pain in his spleen will reach him from the \Moon.''}

\subsection{Lot of Chronic Illness}
The \mn{1.75-76} lot is taken from \Saturn\, to \Mars\, in diurnal charts, \Mars\, to \Saturn\, in nocturnal charts, and projected from the Ascendant; the sign it falls in gives the body part that will be afflicted with chronic illness:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[\Aries]  the head
\item[\Taurus] the neck
\item[\Gemini] the two shoulders
\item[\Cancer] the two hands and the chest
\item[\Leo] the two sides and the heart
\item[\Virgo] the belly and the spine
\item[\Libra] the bladder which is between the two hips
\item[\Scorpio] the penis, and the two testicles, and two buttocks
\item[\Sagittarius] the two thighs
\item[\Capricorn] the two knees
\item[\Aquarius] the two shanks
\item[\Pisces] the two feet
\end{itemize}

To \mn{1.79-80} determine whether the left or right side of the body is harmed, check the 10th sign from the Ascendant. If it contains none of the seven planets, the chronic illness will be on the left side of the body, otherwise, the illness will affect the right side.

Dorotheus \mn{1.77-78} says some ancients used the \Moon\, to describe the body, saying, if the malefics were square or opposed to the \Moon\, and \textsl{``they were looking at life from the ascendent and \Venus\, and \Mercury\, (and the malefics aspect them) and the nature of the place in which they are, if this sign is one of the quadruped signs or one of the human signs or one of the watery signs--and they were looking at this sign to which of the limbs of the body belongs, so that they might say that the chronic illness is in this limb of the body of men.''}\footnote{I think he means the sign the malefic is in determines the body part unless the malefic is aspecting the \Moon\, from the Asc and \Venus\, and \Mercury\, are also aspecting the \Moon\, and the malefic then the sign \Venus\, or \Mercury\, are in determines which limb is harmed. Although the whole section is pretty garbled.}
