\mn{1.65}\textsl{Now I will make clear to you a section on chronic illness.}
\end{quote}

Look \mn{1.66} at the 6th sign from the Ascendant and determine if their nature is humane (\Gemini, \Virgo, \Libra, \Aquarius, and the 1st half of \Sagittarius), quadruped (\Aries, \Taurus, \Leo,  \Capricorn), or wild (\Leo, last half of \Sagittarius). And look at the sign's ruler, its nature and condition.

If \mn{1.67} the sign and its ruler are both in bad condition and they are both moist, \textsl{``then disasters will reach this native from pain due to moisture and cold and pain in his joints, and a long-lasting pain will seize him.''}

If \mn{1.68-69} the sign is \Aries\, or \Scorpio\, (ruled by \Mars) , \textsl{``then a cutting with iron will reach him, and he will be burned in a fire, or dogs or lions will bite him, and some of them will be transfixed by a spear, and many disasters will reach him. These are the disasters if this planet is shining [and] luminous, but if this is covered up under the \Sun's light then pain or torment will reach him, and his belly will be split, and he will die from this.''}

If \mn{1.71-74} \Mars\, is in a sign ruled by \Jupiter, the native will love wine and the disasters will be from his liver. 

If \Mars\, is in a sign ruled by \Venus, the disasters will be from the love of women, \textsl{``their malady will seize him like the form of a madman, his reason and his [sense of ] shame will depart in the search for women; it will be worse for this [native] if \Venus\, is in a masculine sign.''}

If \Mars\, is in a sign ruled by \Mercury, \textsl{``then the reputation of this native will be spoiled and his words, and he will not be about to speak except in misery, and his hearing will decrease, and wretchedness in his throat will seize him.''}

If \Mars\, is in \Leo\, or \Cancer, or his own domicile, \textsl{``then a chronic illness in his eyes will reach him, and a pain in his heart will reach him from the \Sun, and a pain in his spleen will reach him from the \Moon.''}

\subsection{Lot of Chronic Illness}
The \mn{1.75-76} lot is taken from \Saturn\, to \Mars\, in diurnal charts, \Mars\, to \Saturn\, in nocturnal charts, and projected from the Ascendant; the sign it falls in gives the body part that will be afflicted with chronic illness:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[\Aries]  the head
\item[\Taurus] the neck
\item[\Gemini] the two shoulders
\item[\Cancer] the two hands and the chest
\item[\Leo] the two sides and the heart
\item[\Virgo] the belly and the spine
\item[\Libra] the bladder which is between the two hips
\item[\Scorpio] the penis, and the two testicles, and two buttocks
\item[\Sagittarius] the two thighs
\item[\Capricorn] the two knees
\item[\Aquarius] the two shanks
\item[\Pisces] the two feet
\end{itemize}

To \mn{1.79-80} determine whether the left or right side of the body is harmed, check the 10th sign from the Ascendant. If it contains none of the seven planets, the chronic illness will be on the left side of the body, otherwise, the illness will affect the right side.

Dorotheus \mn{1.77-78} says some ancients used the \Moon\, to describe the body, saying, if the malefics were square or opposed to the \Moon\, and \textsl{``they were looking at life from the ascendent and \Venus\, and \Mercury\, (and the malefics aspect them) and the nature of the place in which they are, if this sign is one of the quadruped signs or one of the human signs or one of the watery signs--and they were looking at this sign to which of the limbs of the body belongs, so that they might say that the chronic illness is in this limb of the body of men.''}\footnote{I think he means the sign the malefic is in determines the body part unless the malefic is aspecting the \Moon\, from the Asc and \Venus\, and \Mercury\, are also aspecting the \Moon\, and the malefic then the sign \Venus\, or \Mercury\, are in determines which limb is harmed. Although the whole section is pretty garbled.}

\subsection{Indications from the 4th House}
Check \mn{1.81-4} the triplicity lords of the 4th house; the 1st triplicity lord gives indications for the native's death; the 2nd triplicity lord gives indications for chronic illness, combine its indications with those given by the Lot of Chronic Illness.

\subsection{Configurations indicating chronic illness}
In lines 1.85 to 1.87 Dorotheus describes configurations involving the lot of chronic illness, the lights and either \Mars\, or \Saturn\, or both:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the \Moon\, and the lot of chronic illness in the 11th while \Mars\, is in the 2nd\footnote{Dykes translation has ``in the eighth'';however, the 2nd makes sense here as it is the 10th from the 11th, Zoller taught the 10th place from any house gave indications for the \textsl{outcome} of the house} indicates \textsl{``the body of this native will be broken and his joints will waste away, all of them} but if \Saturn\, is in the 2nd the \textsl{``native will fall from a high, elevated place''} and if the sign [on the 2nd?] is a water sign \textsl{``then these disasters will be from water, or some of the animals of the sea will devour him.''}

\item If \Mars\, and \Saturn\, rise after the \Sun\, and \Moon\, or are in the same sign as the lights, conjunct or in greater degrees, ...,\footnote{The text here is missing} \textsl{``it will be worse for this [native] if it is \Mars\, because nothing will cover up the evil of \Mars\, except God alone, the truth of the world.''}

\item if \mn{1.106-7} the dodecatemorion of the \Sun\, or \Moon\, are in the aspect of a malefic \textsl{``then a chronic illness in his body will reach this native''}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conditions harmful to one's eyesight}
In lines 1.88 to 1.97 Dorotheus describes conditions that can indicate harm to the native's eyesight:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item If \Mars\, is in the 2nd sign from the \Sun\, or \Moon\, \textsl{``then disasters will reach the native in his eye or his vision will depart''}; the harm will be worse if the \Sun\, or \Moon\, are in the \textsl{``sign of life''} (rising sign) and the malefics set after the \Sun\, and \Moon

\item The eyesight is also damaged if the \Moon\, is in the West [7th?] and the malefics are angular, especially if the \Moon\, is full. If the \Sun\, is there instead of the the \Moon\, the same, unless \Jupiter\, aspects the \Sun, as then the native will still be able to see a little; 

\item If the \Sun\, and \Moon\, are in the 7th and \Saturn\, and \Mars\, rise after them then there will be a chronic illness of the eyes (rather than a disastrous loss of vision) and the same if \Mars\, and the \Sun\, are in the 7th in the aspect of \Jupiter

\item If \Mars\, and the \Sun\, or \Moon\, are in the house of life (rising sign), \textsl{``a chronic illness in his eyes will reach him''} and the same if the \Sun\, rises with or after the \Moon\, and \Mars\, is between them

\item If the \Moon\, and \Saturn\, are in \Sagittarius, or the \Moon\, alone is in \Sagittarius\, with \Saturn\, in square or opposition to it\footnote{The text has ``aspecting it from the fourth or from the seventh'' which implies that \Sagittarius\, must be the rising sign, in which case the previous condition would apply and singling out \Sagittarius\, would be unnecessary so I've assumed ``from the 4th'' means in `square' and ``from the 7th'' means in `opposition'.}, \textsl{``a chronic illness will reach the eyes''}

\item If the \Moon\, gives indications for chronic illness or if she aspects the malefics from the 4th place, then \textsl{``this native will not escape from chronic illness, neither because of the remedy of physicians nor by asking God for health, so that he will die from his chronic illness.}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Degrees Injurious to the Eyes}
If \mn{1.108-111} the \Moon\, is in one of the following degrees and is \Conjunction, \Square, or \Opposition\, the malefics while she is waning, \textsl{``the native [will have] darkness in his eye.''} If the \Moon\, is waxing, \textsl{``then a chronic illness in his eye will reach this native, but his eye will not be blinded.''}
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item 6-9 \Taurus, the Pleiades
\item 9 \Cancer
\item 18 \Leo, the mane of the lion
\item 8 \Scorpio, the face of the scorpion
\item 9 \Scorpio, the eyes of the scorpion
\item 10 \Scorpio\footnote{Dykes has ``the forehead of the Scorpion and its eyes, in 8°, 9°, and 10° of Scorpio''}
\item 23 \Scorpio, the scorpion's stinger
\item 3 \Sagittarius, the point of the arrow
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Timing}
The \mn{1.99-102} above indications are based on the radix positions and \textsl{``not on the transfer''} (profected positions). If the year comes to the sign\footnote{I'm interpreting these lines (IV.1.99-102) as if they apply to profected, not radix, positions.} which holds the \Moon\, blockaded between the two malefics, \textsl{``the native will dread this, but discomfort will not get hold of him by the decree of God, and he will escape from the aggregate of ailments and misfortunes''} but if the transfer comes to the sign of the \Sun\, or \Moon\, and they are in the square or opposition of \Saturn\, or \Mars, then \textsl{``a chronic illness in his eyes will reach him''}\footnote{In other words, if a light is in the profected 1st and a malefic is in a profected angle (which happens if they are square or opposed to the light) then what is indicated in the radix (harm to the eyesight) happens in that year.}

\subsection{Side of body affected}
If\mn{1.103-7}  the indications are from the \Sun\, in a diurnal chart then the person's right side, right eye and his right hand will be affected. If the indications are from the \Moon\, in a night chart, then the person's left side, left eye, and their left hand, will be affected. 

\subsection{Various configurations indicating madness}
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item[\Mars] \mn{1.112-114} if \Mars\, is in the 1st in opposition to the \Moon\, in the 7th, \textsl{``then the native will have little life and madness will seize him''}, and it will be worse if the \Moon\, is waning \\ \\
If the \Moon\, is in \Taurus\, or another sign with cut-off limbs\footnote{These possibly include \Capricorn\, and \Sagittarius\, both of which are described by Valens as being ``half-finished''} and \Mars\, is in the 1st or 5th in the aspect\footnote{It is not clear from the text if the aspect must be partile, within 3° or simply by sign} of the \Moon\, \textsl{``then one of the limbs of this native will be cut off by iron so that that limb will be wretched because of it''}

\item[\Jupiter] \mn{1.115} if \Jupiter\, is in the 7th and the \Moon\, and \Mars\, are in the 1st, \textsl{``then madness will seize this native and he will have no reason, and he will not be aware of what he is doing''} and if the benefics rise after the \Moon\, and \Mars\, they will be spoiled and injured\footnote{Unable to prevent the harm?} \\ \\

If \mn{1.121} the \Moon\, and \Jupiter\, are in the 1st and \Mars\, is aspecting from the 7th, \textsl{``then this native will not have reason''}

\item[\Saturn] \mn{1.116} if \Saturn\, is in the 1st or 10th and the \Moon\, is in the 7th, then the native will \textsl{``have no reason, and he will not be aware of what he is doing''} and it will be worse if \Mars\, is with the \Moon; and if the benefics rise after \Saturn\, or the \Moon\, (?) they will be spoiled and injured

\item[\Sun] \mn{1.118} if the \Sun\, and \Moon\, are in the same sign with \Mars\, between them while \Saturn\, is rising after them and in aspect, \textsl{``then this native will not have reason''}, especially if the \Sun\, and \Moon\, are in the 8th but if the benefics are aspecting or rising after them \textsl{``then he will escape from his misfortune''}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Various configurations indicating illness}

If \mn{1.122} the \Moon\, is USB or waning and separating from an angular malefic, \textsl{``then this native will have no strength and no power, and he will be emaciated [and] sick''} and it will be worse if the other malefic is also in aspect with the \Moon.

If \mn{1.123} the \Moon\, is separating from \Saturn, \textsl{``then a pain i the belly will seize him, and his belly will defecate, and a pain of coldness will seize him, and his pain will last a long time, and a pin in the spleen will seize some of them, and he will ask for a drink, and his belly will be split open, and a cough will seize him''} 

If \mn{1.124} the \Moon\, is separating from \Mars, \textsl{``then a pain of the blood will seize him in [his] belly but the medicine of doctors will help him''}

If \mn{1.125} the native is a girl, \textsl{``then all of these diseases will seize her and together with all these diseases other diseases will reach her because her belly will sell up and her child will not live, but her child will be cut off in her belly but she will keep the black bile''}.

If \mn{1.126} the \Moon\, is separating from benefics and will conjoin with benefics before leaving the sign she is in, \textsl{``then the native will be healthy for half his life, then after this he will swell up and diseases will seize him from which he will not escape.''}
