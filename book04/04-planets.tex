\mn{1.185}\textsl{Now I will also make clear to you the transfer of some of the seven to the places of the others.}

\textbf{NOTE:} as a rule Dorotheus' instructions in this section of his work are read in reference to a \textsl{Solar Return} chart drawn for the date and time the \Sun\, returns to its natal position for the year in question. I am reading them with reference to the \textsl{profected} chart which I take to be the original \textsl{turned} chart.

As the radix chart is turned by 30Â° each year to bring a new sign to the Ascendant the planets are seen to occupy different houses and so come into new relationships with the radix planets and lots.
\end{mdframed}

Dorotheus \mn{1.186-7} tells us that when a planet reaches the 7th house from its radix position \textsl{``then it is difficult in its maleficence''} and the same is true when it returns to its own radix house. 

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=cyan!5, rightmargin=1em, leftmargin=1em]
As I understand it, he is saying that if, for example, radix Venus is in the 6th and by profection she appears in the 12th, in opposition to her radix position, then any harm she signifies will be evident in that year and again when she appears back in the 6th, her original place.
\end{mdframed}

In \mn{1.188-9} a diurnal chart, \Mars\, reaching the place of the \Sun\, or \Jupiter\, \textsl{``is worse for this native''} and if a malefic is with the \Sun\, or \Jupiter\, there will be disasters and quarrels with the father. In a nocturnal chart, \Saturn\, reaching the place of the \Moon\, is worse and if a malefic is with the \Moon, there is greater harm to his body.

If \mn{1.190} profected \Saturn\, or \Mars\, is trine\footnote{Pingree has this as ``in triplicity'' but that doesn't fit well with the rest of the thought and ``triplicity'' is sometimes confused with ``trine'' in translations (see Dykes p220, although he is referring to Solar Return placements).} the place in the radix, then it will be better for the native than if it is in the 4th (square) or 7th (opposite) place.

If \mn{1.191-2} the malefics are in a right square (i.e. in the 10th from a place), \textsl{``then there will be no good in it''}, but if the benefics are in a right square, \textsl{``then it will be good''}. And if the benefics are trine\footnote{Again, replacing `triplicities' with `trine'.}, \textsl{``then this native will attain good''}.

\begin{quote}
\mn{1.193}\textsl{If the malefics are in their triplicities, then it will harm this native because the lord of the triplicity [being] \Mars\, by day and \Saturn\, by night is the worst of what might be; it is worse for this [native] if the two in the base-nativity were in a place in which [there is] no good.''}
\end{quote}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=cyan!5, rightmargin=1em, leftmargin=1em]
The only sense I can make out of the above is that, if the malefics are in difficult houses (2nd, 6th, 8th, 12th) the harm will be worse for the person. The reference to `triplicities' makes little sense as \Mars\, does not rule any triplicity by day and \Saturn\, does not rule any triplicity by night. \Mars\, is the nocturnal triplicity ruler for \Cancer, \Scorpio, and \Pisces, while \Saturn\, is the diurnal triplicity ruler for \Gemini, \Libra, and \Aquarius\, unless he means that if they are in their own triplicities but contrary to the chart sect i.e. \Mars\, in a water sign in a day chart, \Saturn\, in an air sign in a night chart; then they will cause more harm since they are stronger \textsl{in} their own triplicities than out of them.
\end{mdframed}

If \mn{1.94} the person is older than 30 the harm from \Saturn\, will be less.

If \mn{1.195, 233} \Saturn\, and \Mars\, \textsl{are rising after the cardines\footnote{Will cross the angles by primary direction?}, then also quarrels and misery will reach the native.} If the malefics are in the cardines, \textsl{``then [there will be] no good in it.''}

If \mn{1.196} \Saturn\, and \Mars, in the radix, are in \textsl{``places in which [there is] no good''} and in the profection the benefics are also brought to places where ``there is no good'', \textsl{``then it will diminish from that good which belonged to the native in that year.''}

If \mn{1.203} \Saturn\, is with the \Moon, \textsl{``then cold will seize this native in this year''}

If \mn{1.204} \Saturn\, reaches its own place, \textsl{``then good will reach this native''}\footnote{In 1.187 we were told a planet reaching its own place is malefic; here we're told a malefic reaching its own place will produce good. Possibly, rather than `place' i.e. house, it should read the place of his domicile? i.e. \Saturn\, in the 2nd returning to the 2nd is malefic but \Saturn\, in the 2nd reaching the place where \Capricorn\, or \Aquarius\, are found, his effects are good?}

If \mn{1.212} \Saturn\, reaches \Mars\, place, \textsl{``then it will spoil the native's heart and it will spoil him, and he himself will be wicked.''}

If \mn{1.232} the \Sun\, and the \Moon\, are in the malefics' places, \textsl{``then [there will be] no good in it.''}

If \mn{1.197-208} the \Moon\, reaches:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item its own place, the native will be cheerful and rejoice, especially if \Venus\, and \Jupiter\, are also there

\item the \Sun's place, \textsl{``there will be good in what belongs to the native after his day''}\footnote{Meaning ``after his birthday'', for the year?}

\item \Mars's place, \textsl{``disasters will immediately reach this native''} unless the benefics aspect the \Moon

\item the \Sun's or \Mars\, place while the \Sun\, or \Mars\, are also where they were in the radix, \textsl{``then the blood will be expelled from this native's body''}

\item \Venus's place and the malefics are not\footnote{The `not' seems weird here, you'd expect what follows if \Venus\, was corrupted by a malefic.} with the \Moon, \textsl{``then in that year this native's property will be wasted in fornication, and he will disgrace himself, and he will be greedy, [and] people will know about him.''}

\item \Mercury's place, \textsl{``then this native will do some work in accordance with the nature of \Mercury''}

\item the 1st place, then native's life will be spoiled

\item the 10th place, then the native's work in will public will be in accord with the nature of aspecting benefics or malefics

\item the 7th place, the native will triumph over his enemies, prosper, and obtain his income

\item the 4th place, the year will concern a secret matter that he will conceal and keep quiet about but if he makes a will, it will be good
\end{itemize}

If \mn{1.210-211}  \Saturn\, and \Mars\, reach:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item \Jupiter's place, \textsl{``then these two spoil the goodness of \Jupiter''}.

\item the place of \Venus\, and \Mercury, \textsl{``then these two diminish from their good.''}
\end{itemize}

If \mn{1.213-216} \Mars\, reaches:

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item \Saturn's place, \textsl{``then it will ameliorate the soul of the native and make it firm and render [him] victorious over his enemies.''}

\item  \Venus' or \Jupiter's place, \textsl{``then it will take away all the natives good in that year.''}

\item \Mars\, is USB, \textsl{``then fever and a hot temperature and a hot pain will seize this native in this year, and it will destroy his reason; if the father of the native is alive, then grief will reach this native because of his father and his state with regard to work and the authority of kings will be spoiled.''}

\item \mn{1.229}\Mercury's place, \textsl{``then this native will worry and will persuade himself of what has no good in it, and he will treat his friends as enemies, and his opinion of them will be low, and their slaves will scorn some of them, and disaster will reach him in his property''}

\item the \Moon's place, \textsl{``then a pain will reach this native in his body, then afterwards he will use his intellect and be victorious over his enemies [with] trouble and difficulty.''}
\end{itemize}

If \mn{1.217- 219} \Jupiter\, reaches:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item \Saturn's place, \textsl{``then it will remove the corruption of \Saturn\, in that year, and he will attain property and good.''}

\item \Mars\, place, \textsl{``then good will increase with regard to the native's properties and he will be victorious over his enemies in that year''}

\item the square of \Mars\, or \Saturn\footnote{This is missing from Pingree's version; added from Dykes (p226) who takes it from Schmidt's translation (p226n160).}, \textsl{``then it is likewise good'.'}
\end{itemize}

If \mn{1.220-224} \Venus\, reaches:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item  \Jupiter's place, \textsl{``then [he will have] no good in the case of women, [and] grief and quarrels will reach the native in this year.''}

\item \Mars\, place, \textsl{``then the native will leave him in anger and will not look at anyone''}

\item \Mercury's place, \textsl{``then it will increase the native's work''}

\item \Moon's lace, \textsl{``then he will be good in [his] work, but a bad reputation in the matter of women will be spread''}

\item \Sun's place, \textsl{``then it will spoil the life of that native and disasters will reach him because of women''}

\item the square of \Mars\, or \Saturn, then it is good\footnote{\textsl{ibid.}}
\end{itemize}

If \mn{1.225-231} \Mercury\, reaches:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em,itemsep=0em]
\item the places of benefics, then it will be good; the places of the malefics, \textsl{``then [there will be] no good int it.''}; and, if neither the benefics nor the malefics aspect \Mercury\, \textsl{``then this native will not be good in his work, but he will remove grief and hardship from himself''}

\item \Jupiter's place, \textsl{``then he will be good in all work; it will be better for this [native] if this native desires entry to [the palaces of] kings.''}

\item \Mars's place, \textsl{``then this native's heart will be strong in every falsehood.''}

\item \Venus's place, \textsl{``then his work will be good and he will attain good.''}

\item the \Moon's place, \textsl{``then the body of this native will be cured and the pain in his joints will depart.''}
\end{itemize}
