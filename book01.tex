\begin{quote}
\textsl{In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate. May the lord be rich in compassion towards you.}

\textsl{This is the first book of Dorotheus the Egyptian, on the judgments concerning nativities. He chose it and selected it and picked it from the books which were before him, and he wrote it for his son Hermes.}

\textsl{He said to his son at the tie of his testament: I shall relate to you, oh my son, and I shall explain to you so that you may depend on and be confident in your heart about what I shall show you of my work and words according to the stars which indicate for men what will pertain to them from the time of a [person's] birth till his leaving the world, if God wills. I have traveled, o my son, in many cities, and I have seen the wondrous things which are in Egypt and in Babylon, which is in the direction of the Euphrates. I collected the best of their sayings from the first [authorities] who were before me like the bees which gather [honey] from the trees and all kinds of plants; for from it there is the honey of medicine.}
